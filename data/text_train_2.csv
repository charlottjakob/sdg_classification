1,paper abstract,"SDG1 presents the global community with an important, but highly challenging goal. When discussing tourism’s potential to contribute to SDG1 to “end poverty in all its forms everywhere”, the multidimensional nature of poverty must be considered rather than focusing solely on economic deprivation. Specifically, we need to shift the focus beyond how tourism can foster economic growth, provide jobs and income, to considering sociopolitical aspects of poverty and how structural inequalities are impeding people’s development. The contradictions involved in poor people, in poor locations, with poor labour rights, putting on smiling faces to serve rich guests of former colonial powers and to clean up their messes, should not be overlooked if we are genuinely interested in challenging the negative aspects of global tourism and making it more equitable and sustainable in the future. Thus, if governments and tourism industry players wish to do more than pay lip service to SDG1, they will need to make some significant changes to the way in which they work. This article will draw inspiration from tourism businesses in Fiji that are addressing SDG1 and related goals, and discuss how they have the potential to contribute to longer-term sustainable development.",1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

If Kenya is to achieve zero hunger by 2030, it will need efforts to scale up the gains made. Currently, effects of climatic shocks, COVID-19, locust invasion and an economy that is not growing as was expected, continue to exacerbate food insecurity. While there have been gains from the long-term rains over the years, these gains are being lost because of an economy that fluctuates and has been weakened first because of the post-election violence in 2007/2008 and now even more because of covid-19. This weak economy is negatively impacting access, not just to food, but also its availability. It is estimated that by the end of this year, many Kenyans will be food insecure requiring humanitarian assistance. While a majority of Kenyans have access to food, they are still unable to meet the recommended rations. Many Kenyans have access to food that is affordable making diets less and less nutritional. Although Kenya is currently a lower-middle income economy, it still has an estimated 238,000 in the emergency phase . Arid and Semi-Arid lands have the highest levels of food insecurity. Changing climatic patterns have led to poor performance of the short rains. Climate change is impacting negatively on already fragile food security situation. Increasing levels of food insecurity threaten to negate the gains made in Kenya’s progress towards zero hunger.

The SDGs mention only a few political indicators and SDG2 in particular is largely devoid of political considerations to end hunger and achieve food security. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen famously observed the absence of famine in democracies, suggesting that a democratic system provides checks and balances that prevent famine. His observation has elicited further debate and triggered empirical studies in recent years. Going beyond Sen’s hypothesis, this essay examines other political factors that would explain vulnerability to famine and that need to be addressed more explicitly in SDG 2 and similar initiatives. By taking the case of pastoralists in the Afar region of Ethiopia, this research explores selected political determinants of vulnerability to famine. The Eritrea-Ethiopia war and the ensuing border closure have had a detrimental effect on the livelihood of pastoralists in Afar – many pastoralists were deprived of a market and a reliable source of income. In addition, Afar pastoralists were sidelined from the informal salt sector on which they used to rely. The state facilitated this expropriation, leaving pastoralists even more vulnerable to famine.

We derive all infinitesimal symmetries of the self-dual gravity equations in -dimensional space–time and introduce an infinite hierarchy of commuting flows on the moduli space of self-dual metrics.

In developing countries, the EU is strongly committed to achieving SDG 2. The EU institutions and Member States, which collectively provide more than half of official development assistance worldwide, have reaffirmed this commitment in the new European 'consensus on development'. Alongside development aid, the EU has several levers at its disposal to act on food insecurity causes, such as security and defence missions and comprehensive strategies in conflict areas, as well as substantial research capacities.

Poor quality education has been reflected among others, in poor academic performance in school children, youth restiveness, juvenile delinquency and other anti-social behaviours predominantly in the youth, all of which are aspects contrary to the main objective of Sustainable Development Goal 4 priorities to realize the 2030 framework’s agenda of sustainable development. Using the case of the University of Botswana Faculty of Education Environmental and Sustainability Education unit, the chapter provides some insights into how teacher education can drive SDG 4 implementation through curriculum innovations and professional development to enhance education quality and relevance.",4,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

This paper explores the challenges of achieving SDG4 for Hong Kong in regard to ensuring equitable and quality educational opportunities for its ethnic minority young people, with a particular focus on equality in educational outcomes. The paper argues that school failure of ethnic minority students in Hong Kong is an educational outcome issue which poses significant challenges for Hong Kong to achieve SDG4. In addition to the Chinese language factor, there are many other interrelated factors at students’ individual, family, school and community level contributing to ethnic minority students’ school failure in Hong Kong.

This research asks the questions, does the data provided give an authentic understanding of the reality of education in Nicaragua?; and what needs to be done, in the case of Nicaragua, in order to best measure SDG 4? To answer these questions, qualitative and quantitative data was gathered from a desk review and interviews with Nicaraguan teachers to create a case study. The case study was then compared to the quantitative data provided for four SDG 4 indicators chosen by the researcher. Comparing the case study to the data, the results found that the data alone did not provide an authentic understanding of the state of education in Nicaragua. The results gathered that the data provided for SDG 4 was minimal due to the lack of political will in Nicaragua, minimal collaboration, inability to collect data, and the disconnect between the SDG 4 indicators and the reality of education in Nicaragua.

73,paper abstract,"So how can policymakers decide which of the five gender inequality indexes is best for tracking their country’s performance on SDG 5? Similarly, how do MNE executives select an index to track their company’s gender equality performance, at home and in their foreign affiliates? We offer three insights into these questions. First, we argue that there is no single right answer. Policymakers and MNE executives need to match their selection of a gender inequality index with the specific gender equality goals and targets they are trying to achieve. The “best” gender inequality index for one government or one MNE may not be the same for another where their goals and targets differ. There may be no “best” index nor “off the shelf” solution; it may be that a single index is not sufficient and will need to be assembled from different indexes. Second, policymakers and MNE executives need to understand why and how the various indexes are constructed; that is, making a “deep dive” into the selection and measurement of indicators and construction of the indexes. A thorough analysis of the various indexes is a necessary first step to selecting or creating an inequality index that best fits the organization. Third, our overall assessment is that, given their strengths and weaknesses, the GII and GGGI are better able to usefully inform policymakers and MNE executives on how to move toward SDG 5 in terms of workplace gender equality. For more holistic measures of gender equality that take account of women’s empowerment, policymakers must look to the new SDG 5 gender indexes.

88,paper abstract,"The paper describes the Global Water Partnership partner experience in the introduction of risk-based Integrated Water Resources Management , and water security. The concept of ‘sustainable management’, in the Russian version of Water SDG6, is translated as ‘rational use’ but no one can explain why. We suggest that such a misunderstanding happened since Ukrainian decision-makers still perceive themselves only as water users who are not obligated to achieve any development goals. Therefore, they are quite comfortable with the existing normative approach to water management where the objectives are compliance with defined norms and ensuring water security, which is understood as an absence of any water risk solely to humans, rather than the environment at large. Keeping in mind that true science starts with measurable values, and recognizing that you cannot manage if you cannot measure, we propose to change this false understanding of water security and sustainability that is inherent in the outmoded concept of ‘rational use’.

This target provides an opportunity as well as a challenge to African countries including Ghana. Indeed, the Ghana Energy Commission estimates that Ghana has about 34 potential hydro sites and enjoys about 330 days of sunshine annually. For instance, the three Northern regions, Volta and northern parts of Brong Ahafo have radiation levels with monthly average of between 4.0 and 6.5kWh/m2/day. These hydro and solar resources, coupled with abundant waste, wind potential of about 2000 MW and tidal potential can make Ghana a net exporter of power when the needed investment is provided.

They contribute to adaptation processes by contributing to reducing the vulnerability of people, improving adaptive capacity, and minimizing climate change risk in line with SDG 7. But these are not without challenges either. Financial, technical, institutional, policy and legal issues are major challenges to promote RETs. This study shows that theoretically altogether 4.45 million tons of CO2e of the GHG emission can be mitigated per year if all the remaining technical potential of deploying seven major RETs consisting of biogas, improved water mill, stand-alone micro-hydro plants, mini-grid micro-hydro plants, solar PV home systems, mud-ICS and metal-ICS were installed after 2012. Considering the average annual installation of these RETs, altogether 30.71 million tons of CO2e can be mitigated between the periods of 2013 to 2030 at an annual additional installation equal to average installation done in recent past three years. The initial technology investment required for implementing the above mentioned RETs ranges from NRs 97 to NRs 23,247 per ton of CO2e mitigation. This indicates that though a moderate level of the initial investment is required for promoting RETs, the GHG mitigation potential seems to be quite promising.

In the past few years, however, critics have objected to the basis for which it should be adopted due to potential negative trade-offs. Sustainable Development Goals number seven seeks to substantially increase contribution of renewable energy to global energy supply, as well as double the rate of improvement in efficiency of energy. Biofuels are likely to play a key role in the pursuit of these goals being one of the most advanced alternative energy sources. This review assesses the potential of biofuels to contribute to the set SDGs by presenting an appraisal of their development over the years. It sheds light on some main arguments surrounding biofuels from the perspective of proponents and critics alike. Even though biofuels have a great potential in aiding climate change mitigation, its large scale adoption is regarded as problematic in its current state. This is because of its potential negative trade-offs in terms of land use change and emissions, especially for first and second generation biofuels.

In this context, this study analyses the potential to embed the SDG 7 target of universal access to clean fuels and technologies into Indiaâ€™s national agenda. The analysis of the present paper shows that at the current pace of deployment of clean cooking technology, it seems unlikely that India will meet the SDG 7 target by 2030. In order to progress towards achieving this target, India needs to adopt a two-pronged technological approach â€“ access to modern cooking fuel needs to be increased alongside efforts to make traditional cooking fuels safer to use.

100,paper abstract,"SDG 8 calls for promoting ‘sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all’. Even as it highlights the importance of labour rights for all, it also makes visible some significant tensions. We note, for example, that despite many critiques of narrow economic measures of growth, the focus here remains on GDP and per capita growth. This is problematic, we argue, because the GDP productive boundary excludes much of social reproductive work. This puts SDG8 in tension with SDG 5 which calls for the recognition of the value of unpaid care and domestic work. There has been a significant increase in the rate of working women in the formal and informal sector. However, there has not been a subsequent gender shift in the doing of social reproductive work. In this paper we argue SDG 8’s focus on decent work and economic growth is inadequate; that productive employment and decent work for all men and women by 2030 needs to take into account the value and costs of social reproduction.

This goal confirms the relationship that exists between decent work and well-being improvement. Specifically, the study focused on the assessment of private employers’ awareness on the SDG 8 and its implications for well-being improvement in Dodoma Capital City, Tanzania. The study adopted a cross-sectional research design. Purposive and random sampling techniques were employed to select the representative sample. Data collection methods comprised of surveys, key informants’ interviews, and documentary review with the private employers’ influenced by Autonomy and Decision Making Theory. A total of 100 individual private employers and employees were directly administered with questionnaires. Descriptive and inferential statistics, such as Chi-squire was used to test for significance of data and regression analysis employed to assess the impact of private employers’ awareness of SDG 8 on well-being improvement. Generally, the findings show that overall, 53.3% of the employers are not aware of the labour right due to lack of enough knowledge on the SDG 8. This is correlated with the employers’ unawareness of the SDG 8 which has influence on the protection of labour rights. The regression estimates on the impact of employers’ awareness of SDG 8 on well-being improvement indicates that the knowledge awareness and work experience among the employers were statistically significant. This demonstrate that the wellbeing improvement are mostly contributed by factors such as employers and employee’s knowledge and awareness of SDG 8 and work experience. The study concludes that despite many progresses in the private sector, not all the workforce is enjoying decent work.

104,paper abstract,"SDG 8 covers conventional economic policy goals like GDP growth and employment for which governments established agencies compiling the relevant data long ago. Since many years, national and international research institutes engage in forecasting economic activity to provide guidance for economic policy. The goals summarised in SDG 8, however, go also beyond conventional economic indicators, extending them to inclusive and sustainable growth and decent work for all. Indicators reflecting a broader view on the labour market, like the “inactive population due to caring responsibilities” or covering information on “people killed in accidents at work” or the “work at-risk-of-poverty rate” now complement traditional economic variables. Some of these indicators, however, are published with considerable time lag and there is not yet an established regular forecasting process covering them. The lack of timely information became obvious in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the lockdown measures, necessary to confine the spread of the virus, did not only create a steep decline in economic activity but also had consequences on the amount of caring responsibilities within families, when schools switched from class room to digital teaching. In addition to the negative consequences for employment, the sharp economic downturn also weighed on working income due to the reduction in working hours or the partial income loss associated with short-time work schemes. The strong interaction between labour market data and the disposable income of private households creates synergies between the nowcasting of key and multipurpose indicators in SDG 8.

It is believed that sustainable industrialization, together with innovation and infrastructure, can facilitate a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. However, public financing of SDG goals has been inadequate and the sheer size of the impending SDG financing necessary to be deployed in sub-Saharan African countries to meet SDG funding needs necessitates exploring alternative sources of financing. The chapter summarizes the extant literature around the potential link between sukuk and SDG-9. It provides insights on how the Islamic bond instrument can facilitate a structural shift toward more innovation and technology-oriented industrial activities and resilient infrastructure by 2030 in sub-Saharan Africa. The study finds that sukuk presents a potent and underutilized option as a way forward for financing SDG-9.

Still, the primary outcomes come from the 2017 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, the 2020 Voluntary National Reviews reports as well as scientific literature. Unfortunately, there appears to be a lack of reliable SDG9 information available, and what exists is hard to find. In general, information sources often offer qualitative information, and quantitative data are scarce.

Disadvantaged ethnic and religious groups experience poor access to, representation in and outcomes from public services such as healthcare and education. As mechanisms for social participation and citizenship, public services are key to inclusive and sustainable societies. In this paper we present results of a systematic review on strategies for the inclusion of minority ethnic and religious communities, often neglected populations in term of sustainable development activity. We focus on four public service areas: education, health, local government and police services and identify evidence gaps. Our overall aim is to raise awareness and provoke debate, reflection and subsequently action towards the inclusion of disadvantaged ethnic and religious minorities within public services. Public service inclusion strategies were identified through a global evidence review and four country specific reviews conducted by the Socially Inclusive Cities Network - academics, NGOs, policy - makers and practitioners from India, Kenya, Nigeria, Vietnam and the UK. Published evidence was supplemented by country-based and international workshops involving over 230 relevant stakeholders. We specifically explored intersectional experience relating to gender, age and migration status. 56 publications were identified for the global review, mostly in health and education. Macro arena were identified as three distinct but interconnected levels through which exclusion is operationalized. Three overarching frameworks appeared key to successful ethnic and religious inclusion initiatives: accounting for social context; multiple strategies for system reform; and collaboration with disadvantaged communities. Inclusion strategies that address macro, meso and micro level drivers of exclusion are needed to achieve the aspirations of SDG 10.

122,paper abstract,"In response to growing political concerns about the rise in inequality within and between countries, the Sustainable Development Goals include what appears to be a groundbreaking goal to reduce inequality in the form of SDG 10. This study used desk research to explore what led to its inclusion by analyzing the negotiation process on goal, targets, and indicators. The results show that CSOs demanded a global norm on reducing vertical economic inequality as part of a stand-alone goal. On the other hand, the states part of the UN Open Working Group on SDGs framed inequality merely as social inclusion, to be addressed throughout the framework. SDG 10 was included when developing countries, unsatisfied with the lack of between-country inequality targets, joined CSOs. At face value, the goal conveys a transformative global norm, but this is misleading as states refused a target measuring the gap between the top and bottom incomes. In combination with watered down targets and indicators, this led to a misalignment between the title of the goal and its content.This shows that despite the open nature of the OWG, member states remained by far the most influential decision-makers and successfully used an “ignore-and-reframe” strategy to keep politically sensitive proposals out of SDG10. An exciting avenue to explore further would be whether the inclusion of SDG10 makes a global norm on reducing vertical economic inequality in the future more likely, and what would be needed to achieve this.",10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1
123,paper abstract,"Sustainable Development Goal 10, Reduce Inequality In and Among Countries, was among the last of the SDGs to be added. SDG 10 was largely a reaction to the increasing attention being paid to the gross disparities of wealth observed around the world, and the political backlash to those disparities. While it can be understood as a call for some redistribution of wealth globally, it is unlikely that large-scale redistribution through taxation or other means is politically feasible as a solution to inequality any time soon. It is more plausibly interpreted as a call for a reduction of inequities - those factors that prevent people and states from having a fair shot at the achievement of prosperity and development. Within nation states, we can see this as a call for a rights-based approach to development - an approach that seeks to give people the capabilities to succeed while also removing the political and social factors, such as discrimination and repression, that prevent them from achieving their potential. Internationally, it is related to the concept of a right to development, which places obligations of assistance on developed states to aid poorer ones. International institutions such as the World Bank and the United Nations have a mandate to promote such rights, and can act as intervening institutions, lending credibility to this drive for the recognition of development rights. The targets set by SDG 10 are more vague and aspirational than those of most other of the SDGs, but the end of gross inequalities of wealth might be seen as a foundational issue that makes many other SDGs possible.

Consequently, it has failed to fulfil the institutional and policy aspirations of Islamic economic system. This statement is investigated with an empirical study.

In recent years, there have been progress in national statistics and censuses survey yet data gathering in many African countries are not accurate, timely, disaggregated and widely usable. This often diminish the capability of governments to tackle urban development challenges, which are particularly exacerbated by inequality, poverty and uncontrolled development especially in cities. To support knowledge driven decisions and policies there is need to improve data-gathering systems about health, education, and safety, economy and poverty, land, housing and environment, trade and commerce, population and demography. Also, the underlying dynamics, processes, distributions, patterns, trends or disparities inherent in African cities require the breaking down of aggregated data into their component parts or smaller units, which underscores urban data revolution towards achieving SDG 11. In Africa, the process of bringing together diverse data communities to embrace a diverse range of data sources, tools, and innovative technologies, to provide disaggregated data for decision-making, service delivery and citizen engagement is still emerging.

Life cycle assessment, with its integrated holistic approach, is considered a reference method for the assessment of the environmental impact of production and consumption. This paper presents a study on the environmental impacts of final consumption in Europe in five areas of consumption: food, mobility, housing, household goods, and appliances. Based on the selection of a set of representative products to meet food, mobility, housing, and other consumers’ needs, environmental impacts of products are assessed over their full life cycle: from raw material extraction to production, distribution, use, and end-of-life phase. Life cycle inventories of representative products are multiplied by consumption statistics to assess the impact of an average European citizen in 2010 and 2015. Impacts are assessed considering the sixteen impact categories of the Environmental Footprint method. Results reveal that food is the most relevant area of consumption driving environmental impacts. Use phase is the most important life cycle stage for many impact categories, especially for the areas of consumption housing, mobility, and appliances. For the areas of consumption food and household goods, the most important life cycle phase is related to upstream processes, which corresponds to agricultural activities for food and manufacturing of products components for household goods.

It examines the Oceans Goal as part of the SDGs and considers in more detail the process of nexus thinking, in particular as it relates to the ocean-climate nexus. This highlights that there are risks in relying on SDG interaction analysis due to skewed results or a failure to accommodate rapid transformation or knowledge gain in certain fields.

173,paper abstract,"The livelihoods of more than 30 per cent of the total population in India residing in nine maritime states and four Union Territories are dependent on the diverse ecosystem services offered by coastal and marine systems. Marine fisheries contribute significantly to the Indian economy through the foreign exchange from the export of seafood which corresponds to nearly 5 per cent of the overall export and 20 per cent of the agro-export. In recent times, the anthropogenic pressures due to extensive marine fishing introduce challenges in the marine environment. Marine anthropogeomorphology, capable of transforming the natural settings of the continental shelf dominantly, is often not studied in detail from the perspective of sustainable fishing. For example, the use of the assorted fishing gears can damage the sea floor, apart from the capture of juvenile and non-target fishes. Bottom trawling by mechanised crafts as a part of marine fishing affects the geomorphology of the continental shelf and continental slope by displacing boulders, interrupting the structure of the sediment column, resuspending sediments, and imprinting deep holes on the muddy sea bottom. Occasionally, the abandoned fishing nets/gears on the seafloor are also responsible for the geomorphological damages to the bottom of the sea and death of several marine benthic flora and fauna, a phenomenon referred to as ""ghost fishing"". Further, Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated is the nodal agency, which disseminates PFZ advisory since 1999 using remotely sensed datasets of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a to reduce the uncertainty during marine fishing.

Ecosystems are threatened throughout the region due to expanding and increasingly intensive agriculture, unsustainable oil palm and rubber plantations, fires, forest clearance, poorly regulated extractives industries, aquaculture and illegal wildlife trade. The total forest area has increased in Asia since 1990 but this figure hides the continuing loss of natural forests behind the expansion of planted forests, and sub-regional trends differ. Southeast Asia, for example, shows an increased rate of forest cover loss as well as a reduction in biomass stocks , despite an increased area of protected forests and stability in areas under forest management plans1.

We suggest operationalizing the concept of partnership according to different levels of accountability and participation, allowing for a gradual enhancement of the quality of partnership in terms of ‘meaningfulness.’ We apply our analytical model to the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well‐Being for All , a fairly new initiative by health and development agencies to accelerate progress towards the health-related targets of the 2030 Agenda. By investigating the development and the early phase of implementing the GAP, we empirically assess if and how the notion of partnership envisioned in the GAP qualifies as ‘meaningful’ with respect to civil society engagement. From our empirical example, we infer lessons for attaining normative standards of ‘meaningfulness’ and highlight implications for future research on partnerships.",17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

196,paper abstract,"Associated with this issue, one of the newly specified direct paths suggests there is a positive relationship between the communication of expectation and cooperation. This direct path was identified as most significant in the model. Communication was hypothesized to be mediated through trust. However, more specifically, when referring to the communication of expectations, trust as a mediating variable may not be needed. The scales that contributed to the communication of expectations were associated with formal written agreements and the explicit articulation of the expectations of the parties involved. When the roles and responsibilities are clearly defined trust may not be needed as a mediating factor. Within the case study, written agreements were not deemed as necessary between partners who already had a pre-existing relationship. However, when the large financial investment was required a formal written agreement was deemed essential. As previously stated, cooperation is related to the interdependence between parties, which is aligned with the management of expectations, through a willingness to share tangible and intangible resources.",17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

Nevertheless, the exercise of corporate accountability is challenging as it requires stronger corporate capacity and commitment to respond to external stakeholders in alignment with voluntary regulatory norms. In response, corporate agendas are being significantly shaped by internal and external stakeholders that are employees, suppliers, and customers. Yet, an examination of the current status of accountability both as a historical trend and in current corporate agendas in selected cases shows an increasing gap between policy and impact.

In the early 2000s, Business Ethics was dedicated to helping the Businesses in need that are in these countries. However, owing to the strong backlash from critics, they have changed their focus into helping businesses that are going to help the most people develop. These policies have improved the quality of life of the people. However, this facilitation changes the norms and, in turn, harms some groups. In order to enforce the new policies in an ethical manner Business Ethicists have created a cost-benefit analysis, placing an emphasis on basic necessities. These concerns have become so great that Business Ethicists have created a new department called Development Ethics. Now, instead of simply helping developing businesses, international business developers have begun ensuring that the companies keep basic human rights in mind. This especially applies to countries where the laws are not so strict and allow for abuse to take place. These development policies now have to follow the criteria that Penz created, consisting of: security, empowerment, rights, equity, integrity, and cultural freedom.[10] The idea of providing people with human rights in order to facilitate business development can be seen through the rapid development of China in the last few decades.

543,wikipedia article,"With companies becoming more and more conscious of ethical practices, closely watching themselves to avoid scrutiny, a company's reputation has become a great concern. Ethical business practices are closely tied with reputation which makes it essential to follow ethical guidelines if a company is looking to build their reputation. In fact, businesses that develop quickly and successfully have tendencies to show honesty, impartiality, and service to all of their stakeholders. In order for a company to be considered ""ethical"", it must cater to the needs of the customer, keeping their best interest in mind. This will influence customers to make repeated purchases and lead to more profit. In order for a company to build a strong reputation with their suppliers, it is crucial for them to focus on impartial business interactions and developing long relationships. These relationships can lead to mutually-beneficial business deals for both the company and its supplier. With the employees, they must take their interests into consideration and facilitate teamwork as opposed to rigorous competition. This ensures that the company will keep their most loyal and dedicated employees for as long as possible. Funding for further development can rise when a company is able to develop strong relationship with each stakeholder individually, and ethically. This is based on the concept of reciprocation, which states how in order for social change to take place between groups of people, trust must be built between them through mutually beneficial actions. This can be supported through the results of a questionnaire study that was conducted on technology industries in GTSM and TSE.[12] In addition, in order for a company to practice business ethics, and ensure strong business development, it is essential to maintain a positive relationship with the environment. With concerns about the recent decline of the environment increasing, stakeholders have become more involved in efforts to preserve resources and a negative impact on the environment brings about risks of damaging stakeholder relationships.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

585,wikipedia article,"Quantum finance is an interdisciplinary research field, applying theories and methods developed by quantum physicists and economists in order to solve problems in finance. It is a branch of econophysics.Finance theory is heavily based on financial instrument pricing such as stock option pricing. Many of the problems facing the finance community have no known analytical solution. As a result, numerical methods and computer simulations for solving these problems have proliferated. This research area is known as computational finance. Many computational finance problems have a high degree of computational complexity and are slow to converge to a solution on classical computers. In particular, when it comes to option pricing, there is additional complexity resulting from the need to respond to quickly changing markets. For example, in order to take advantage of inaccurately priced stock options, the computation must complete before the next change in the almost continuously changing stock market.

During the same period, the Sumerian city of Uruk in Mesopotamia supported trade by lending as well as the use of interest. In Sumerian, “interest” was mas, which translates to ""calf"". In Greece and Egypt, the words used for interest, tokos and ms respectively, meant “to give birth”. In these cultures, interest indicated a valuable increase, and seemed to consider it from the lender's point of view.[36] The Code of Hammurabi included laws governing banking operations.

Hot blast, patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron.

939,sustainability report,SDG CASE STUDY Horizon is a key player in the UKs energy system transition due its deployment of millions of pounds of investment to install smart meters across UK households and business premises. The UK Government has set a net zero carbon national target for and via the Energy Act and the Smart Meters Act required that a countrywide adoption of smart meters will be a mandatory step and key enabler to achieve that national target. Smart metering technologies allow realtime visibility of energy use consumer control over their energy consumption timebased variable taris and ease in switching to lower carbon energy suppliers. Visibility provides users with data to understand measure and reduce their energy usage. The introduction of time ofuse taris helps shift energy consumption to periods of low demand andor high renewable generation reducing the need for grid reinforcement supply from fossil fuels or curtailment of renewable plants contributing to UNs SDG Responsible Production and Consumption and SDG Climate Action. Smart meters are also a key technology to allow energy suppliers to oer pioneering packages to consumers such as Agile Octopus marketed by Horizons key client Octopus Energy. Through the use of smart meters and realtime email and text message notications Octopus provides its end users with the opportunity to adopt a dynamic pricedriven use of energy alerting customers to time windows where it possible for consumers to be paid for electricity consumption when taking excess energy o the grid for example when the grid is oversupplied by renewables and paying users of energy is required to balance the grid. This allows customers to shift nontime sensitive consumption to windows when renewables are plentiful and costs are low or nonexistent supporting aordable and renewable energy consumption patterns in line with SDG Aordable and Clean Energy. Beyond smart meters Horizon is developing a platform to fund the infrastructure required in adjacent technologies of EV charging and heat pumps with partnerships already agreed and pilot projects being launched. While the adoption of these technologies is not yet widespread the support of capital deployment from Horizon is key to accelerating the development of these segments. An established reliable and capillary EV charging infrastructure is an essential requirement to phase out Internal Combustion Engine ICE vehicles. In the UK the government is understood to be planning to bring forward the ban on purchase of new ICE vehicles to from the current target date. Similarly adoption of alternative sustainable heating solutions is also seen as a priority by the UK Government as outlined in the Energy White Paper. Horizons role in funding the UKs evolving energy infrastructure positions the business as a key enabler of the UK Governments netzero carbon strategy and its compliance with international climate agreement commitments supporting the SDG Partnership for the Goals.,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0

Overview of Project Naledi Formally launched in the project aims to help local children improve their education and life prospects. It was important to us to make longterm relationships to work together to give children in overcrowded underprivileged schools an initiative that would have a lasting positive effect. We partnered with a local school and charity who run a Saturday school open to children from schools throughout the local area to help children in key subjects. Having now come through the difculties of the pandemic the project has expanded to close to learners and additional extracurricular activities such as basketball athletics and ballet have been added to the programme. The children have access to a working fruit vegetable and herb garden which also serves the local community in Mafolo a district of Soweto. We provide financial support to the Saturday school including tutor expenses catering transportation costs equipment and expanded that contribution this year to include the provision of a librarian for the new library and a sanitation assistant creating job opportunities for the local area where unemployment is at a staggering. We are hopeful that over time in conjunction with our partners we can reach the point where the whole of Project Naledi can become selfsufcient.

The companys development should not deny opportunities for future generations and we should be a sustainable port which takes responsibility for the environment and society we are a part of.This also sets the course for how we manage our sustainability work at CMP. At a general level this management of sustainability work is based on CMPs strategy and business plan which have been established by the companys management team and board of directors. This is used as a basis for targeting CMPs sustainability agenda our focus areas and how we relate to Agenda . The companywide tool MS Progress is then used for the operational management of our activities where sustainability targets are established and monitored in the same manner as with our other business targets. They are then broken down into specific activities at departmental and individual level to ensure that the development of the company is driven in a common direction.During the year a recertification of our environmental management system ISO was completed which forms the basis and sets a structure for much of the environmental work within CMP. Today many companies and customers require their partners to be ISO certified as the standard serves as a form of quality assurance where an external auditor validates that a systematic environmental management is in place.The recertification takes place once every third year and involves a thorough review of the entire company. The focus is on ensuring compliance with environmental regulations and that good practices are in place as well as continuous strategic work with established environmental goals relevant to the operations.

RBI contributes to the improvement of education by actively promoting an understanding of nancial products and services and imparting banking expertise as part of its daytoday advisory role. The nature of its core business means it has close links with the subject of nancial education i.e. the competent handling of money and nancial matters also known as nancial literacy. Appealing to various age groups and integrating employees into corporate volunteering programs makes it possible to reach everyone from schoolchildren and students through to the wider public via a variety of channels. Across various projects considerable effort goes into improving individuals everyday lives and through nancial education to laying the foundations for the responsible handling of money in the future. Tatra banka a.s. has developed a virtual reality VR app for iOS and Android smartphones in order to familiarize students at secondary schools in Slovakia with nancial topics. Numerous studies have shown that nancial literacy in the country is extremely low and previous efforts to improve it have been unsuccessful. Based on the ndings of the National Bank of Slovakia Tatra banka a.s. be making their rst nancial decisions in their own right sooner or later. At the same time another survey found that young people are not remotely interested in nancial topics and that they have an attention span of just eight seconds or so. This situation demanded the development of an attractive educational solution. The result was an innovative smartphone app. Users place their mobile phone into a cardboard D viewer before launching the app. Financial literacy is taught through play in the form of a virtual reality VR experience The use of the virtual reality enhances the students attention and enables a degree of immersion in the material. The content involves a VR roleplaying game from a rstperson perspective were the life of a young photographer and his path to success is followed. This camera perspective gives the player power to see the game through their own eyes rather than controlling it from outside. The player is required to take important nancial and life decisions that inuence the progress of the game. These interactive VR lms like those used in the interactive Netix movie Black Mirror Bandersnatch are intended not only to increase nancial literacy but also to encourage an appropriate attitude towards longterm life goals. The project is currently in the pilot phase with six outstanding secondary schools in Slovakia using the app in lessons. Find more at www.fenome nysveta.sk vr generation krabica Tatra Banka a.s.

980,sustainability report,Focus on innovation The energy sector is simultaneously undergoing several transformations decarbonisation decentralisation and digitisation. And even though some of these transformations are specific to the energy sector and lead to a higher electrification of society others also affect multiple spheres. Furthermore has been a year marked by the pandemic by the brisk adoption of digital teleworking tools and by the difficulties many entities have faced to maintain their activity. However innovation has not stopped because nowadays innovating in the energy industry means thinking and trying new ways to adapt to an environment featuring all kinds of changes quickly dismissing the solutions that do not add sufficient value and simplicity for all the stakeholders which have placed their hopes in electrification in order to attain the decarbonisation of the economy.

WATSAN UPGRADES AND CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN MOGADISHU Phase of our Mogadishu Water and Sanitation WATSAN facilities upgrades was completed in October. It involved building two large RO plant facilities drilling a borehole to supply a raw water source major plumbing works the procurement and installation of two new wastewater treatment plants and the installation of two large water tanks each with a capacity of litres. Water from the RO systems was analysed by two different certified laboratories in Nairobi Kenya confirming that it met the World Health Organizations drinking water standard. We also ran tests to benchmark our water quality against that of bottled water in Somalia and the results clearly indicated that RAs tap water reached a higher standard being closer in quality to natural spring water. We have a laboratory on site where we continue to test the RO water quality daily. As a direct result of this initiative RA stopped buying bottled water for all its Mogadishu staff on February st . Shortly after completing Phase of the WATSAN upgrades we began Phase. This involves the refurbishment of four wastewater treatment plants and procurement of one new water treatment plant. While we have for a long time treated our wastewater and drained it to soakaway at no risk to the environment completing Phase will allow us to begin reusing this treated wastewater for irrigation and construction and for washing facilities vehicles and equipment. Our Mogadishu WATSAN upgrades show that it is possible to create a sustainable closed loop water system. FRIENDLY REMINDERS Several initiatives were introduced across our operations in with a view to increasing awareness of our sustainability efforts among clients and guests. Placing towel cards in our guests rooms is one example. This led to a reduction in the number of towels being laundered each day and a subsequent reduction in water and detergent consumption.

991,sustainability report,Ecological product responsibility Carbon policy RBI is committed to promoting environmentally friendly technologies. The declared ght against climate change based on the Paris climate agreement has given impetus to our ambitions in this area. We see this as a chance for new business elds such as in the areas of renewable energy electric mobility energy efciency and resource management. The climate agreement could drive investments in these areas and provide new impetus for innovation. We have therefore established restrictions on our own practices that apply across the entire RBI. For example we avoid nancing new thermal coal mining projects and new business relationships with customers in the thermal coal mining sector or companies where more than percent of the revenue is generated from thermal coal trading. Coal power plants are only nancially invested in on a selective basis and only if the project offers discernible positive environmental impacts. We are striving to signicantly reduce our involvement with thermal coal. Social product responsibility RBI is aware of the impacts of its business activities on society. Virtually all payment transactions are processed through banks and by issuing loans banks have an inuence on the purposes for which funding is utilized. Our products and services can therefore directly contribute to changing the life situations and consumer behavior of the population. Indirect inuences arise through investments in projects or companies with particular social or societal relevance from which people could either benet or be disadvantaged. RBI cares about the environment. We therefore always consider the associated environmental consequences of the products and services we offer. In particular nancing of or participation in transactions or projects which put the environment at risk of lasting effect are not in accordance with our business policy.

998,sustainability report,RA INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT HOTSPOTS AND HOW TO IMPROVE THEM The report was finalised in September. It showed that most of our greenhouse gas emissions come from the use of oil and what is termed Scope see chart on page. These are indirect emissions that occur in the value chain and include the use of construction materials food and drink electrical equipment and anything else purchased for use in operations. In our case the heaviest impacts come from electricity generation from oil food and drink metal products for our Mogadishu projects cement usage and air travel. As the chart opposite shows our hotspots include the use of construction materials food and drink electrical equipment and plastics. In fact anything thats purchased for use in operations plus of course air travel. Having identified these hotspots we began planning actions to cool them. For example we are exploring different construction methods and systems to reduce our dependence on cement. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT Food DrinkCement Mixed MetalBricksPlastic OilIron Paper Air Travel Liquid FuelsTonnes of CO When it comes to food we are investigating various options such as carbonfriendly menus and have already rolled out alternatives to bottled water in various locations see sections on Singleuse plastics and WATSAN upgrades on pages . In terms of renewable electricity generation we continue to follow developments in the viability and practicality of solar generation more details in the Solar panel section on page.We are also addressing Scope and Scope. In Scope that means paying particular attention to our own or hired vehicles fuel and gas usage for transport heating and cooking and the use of refrigerants. Scope emissions are negligible for most projects since we generate our own energy rather than tapping into national grids. However this is likely to become more relevant as we expand into new territories where we can access national power grids.,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0

1008,sustainability report,The Banks own emissions Carbonneutral banking operations in Climate and environmental impacts constitute a major challenge to our society and Spar Nord takes an interest in and coresponsibility for tackling this challenge. Accordingly Spar Nord is a signatory to the UNs Sustainable Development Goals SDGs UN Global Compact which form the foundation for our efforts to reduce our negative carbon footprint. In its current strategy plan Spar Nord has defined an ambition of making the Bank carbon neutral over a period of time. Through reduction and compensation measures we realised the goal of climateneutrality on scopes and by the end of. Mangrove trees providing climate compensation Spar Nord has opted to compensate for the part of the Banks greenhouse gas emissions that we are still not able to reduce ourselves a total of. tCOe. We do so by purchasing climate credits in the Thor Heyerdahl Climate Park which will contribute to the planting of mangrove forests in Myanmar. We decided to support this project because mangrove trees absorb up to five times as much COe as other trees and store COe directly in the soil. Furthermore as mangrove trees are easy to plant and grow quickly a great effect is achieved relatively quickly. The project also contributes to creating jobs and build a circular society ensuring better living conditions for the local population. Spar Nord will continue its efforts to launch initiatives that may contribute to ensuring full climate neutrality for the Banks operations without having to compensate using climate credits. To succeed in these endeavours we depend on all collaboration partners to prepare and publish their climate accounts. Spar Nord will therefore regularly seek to affect collaboration partners as well as suppliers to prepare climate accounts and commence the journey towards a greener transition. Indirect emissions from key suppliers A large and heavy item in the Banks overall climate accounts is the indirect COe emissions from key suppliers such as the data centre BEC Financial Technologies which provides technology and operational services to Spar Nord. In BEC Financial Technologies emitted a total of tCOe. Spar Nord owns BEC Financial Technologies together with other banks with Spar Nord holding an ownership interest of.. As Spar Nord consistently seeks to improve its data and insights into our total carbon footprint we have opted to estimate the COe emissions from BEC Financial Technologies under scope based on our percentage ownership. As we gradually gain more insights into the climate accounts of other suppliers we will also include their emission figures under scope. To compensate for. tCOe Spar Nord has financed the planting of mangrove trees on two hectares of land in the Thor Heyerdahl Climate Park Myanmar.,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0

1026,sustainability report,This objective will be further supported by the publication of sciencebased targets which are required to be submitted publicly in. The performance of an annual impact analysis will become a xed element of our portfolio analysis. In sustainability targets were agreed at the level of the RBI AG Management Board and these will also be disclosed transparently in the Compensation Report. These targets will be continuously adjusted to reect the results of the impact analysis see also the Compensation Report on the companys website and the Sustainability program section on page. According to the analysis RBI has the biggest positive impact in the following areas manufacture of medical products that contribute to health and wellbeing as well as nancing in the healthcare sector that facilitates access to the corresponding care. Real estate nancing can also contribute to peoples wellbeing. Another aspect is the agricultural production of highquality foodstuffs that improve peoples health and wellbeing. additional materials for repairing metal products machinery and equipment. of the cornerstones of a functional economy. Our agricultural nancing is also important for the supply chains of downstream sectors such as food and drink or accommodation. The provision of nancing to public authorities and the education sector helps to promote economic activity. Our nancing provides SMEs with access to funding in the rst place. helping to prevent greenhouse gas emissions. In the area of forestry our nancing helps to improve carbon capture and storage CCS capacities. Reforestation is one of the main factors in reducing carbon emissions. Economic sustainability Economically successful business is a prerequisite for ensuring the longterm survival and success of a company. Economic value creation is generally the primary goal of productive activities. Only this ensures that other ethical objectives can also be realized. Through the economic value creation of its business activities RBI generates additional benet for the company itself as well as for its owners and employees its customers and the economy in general. In this way it makes an important contribution to the stability resilience and productivity of the economic system and the prosperity of society. We are fully aware of the associated responsibility. Another requirement is ensuring appropriate capital resources. The concept of Group risk controlling comprises a sustainability perspective that should ensure that RBI has a sufciently high core capital ratio at the end of a planning period even if the macroeconomic environment worsens unexpectedly details can be found in RBIs Annual Report starting on page.

1036,sustainability report,CASE STUDY MIXERGY Mixergy is dedicated to developing intelligent solutions which address the challenges around the electrication of heat whilst simultaneously adding exibility to the energy system. It is achieving this through cost eective energyecient and convenient solutions for householders installers and developers. Mixergys agship product is the Mixergy Tank a smart hot water tank which saves energy by only heating what you need whilst providing a reliable energy storage service to utilities and network operators. The Mixergy tank has been launched nationally through British Gas and is now delivering over megawatt MW of exibility to National Grid which is being monetised through Mixergys powerful software platform. Mixergys customers are benetting through intelligent sensing and control which provides visibility of how much hot water is in each tank at all times. The s is the decade to decarbonise heat and the role that smart and connected hot water cylinders can play in helping social landlords to make the challenging transition to low carbon heating. Ambitious policy and tightening regulations are rapidly accelerating the uptake of Mixergy tanks in new build housing where systems can be easily installed alongside heat pumps solar PV and solar thermal as well as conventional boiler or electric heating systems. But the greater challenge lies in the decarbonisation of heat in existing housing stock. Mixergy supports social housing providers in the transition from the old to the new with smart connected hot water storage which gives tenants a better faster and cheaper solution for their hot water needs whilst also reducing carbon emissions. Highlights The Mixergy tank can also be easily programmed to take advantage of opeak taris or new dynamic timeofuse taris. For tenants on mains gas Mixergy has been demonstrated to save up to on gas consumption through better smarter control of the cylinder setpoint temperature and on average reduction in gas consumption in hot water production Veried by the Energy Savings Trust. Aside from these direct savings Mixergy tanks provide a zerocost way for residents to improve their understanding of energy eciency by being able to interact through a simple and intuitive gauge or through the Mixergy App. In Mixergy worked on a case study with Ocean Housing with the project producing reduction in running costs from to per year reduction in carbon emissions reduction in energy consumed.,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

1038,sustainability report,ANNUAL REPORT ON SUSTAINABILITY Water Stewardship WHY IT MATTERS Access to safe water is a fundamental human right. Water is essential to the wellbeing of our communities and the environment and is necessary for our mines smelters processing facilities and reclamation projects. Many of our operations are in arid environments where competition for water supply is signicant. Although we typically have sucient water for our Indonesia operations the PTFI Highlands area receives considerable rainfall that makes management of excess water supply the primary challenge. The unique circumstances at each of our operations reinforce the critical importance of managing the impacts of our activities on water availability and quality optimizing our water utilization and respecting the rights of others. OUR APPROACH Freeport believes eective water stewardship means maximizing our water use eciency so that we can minimize our use of new freshwater. This includes shifting our water supplies to more sustainable sources minimizing negative impacts from our operations on water quality and availability in a local catchment and supporting the development of access to previously unknown unavailable or undeveloped water resources. In addition to focusing on our own waterrelated supply risks surrounding our operations water stewardship also means we are focused on promoting longterm water security for all. We recognize the importance of working collaboratively with our stakeholders to secure access to water in a socially and environmentally responsible manner and we are dedicated to improving our water programs over time. Policies Programs Globally our objective is to identify manage and mitigate both our current and future waterrelated risks to secure the necessary water resources vital to support our operations over the long term while equitably supporting the rights and wellbeing of our local community partners and ecosystems. Our global water management program goals are the following improve water use eciency in our processes minimize use of freshwater at our operations reduce our water footprint by transitioning to renewable or recycled water sources and monitor our impact on the surrounding communities and environment by continually reviewing water supplies and future requirements. We support and are in the process of implementing the ICMM Water Position Statement which outlines our commitment to public reporting and responsible water use including strong and transparent water governance eective water management and collaboration towards achieving responsible and sustainable water use. In we published our Water Report to enhance transparency and accountability of our water management which is available on our website.Cerro Verde in partnership with the Government of Arequipa provides clean drinking water in Arequipa Peru photo captured preCOVID.,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

1052,sustainability report,Health Safety WHY IT MATTERS Mining by its nature is associated with hazardous work that must be carefully understood and managed. Workforce safety is essential to operational success. On a daily basis our mining workforces engage in highrisk activities such as drilling and blasting rock operating heavy machinery using chemicals working with highvoltage electricity working at heights or below surface working with hightemperature materials as well as other highrisk tasks. OUR APPROACH Safety is a core company value and is foundational to our sustainability approach. Our highest priority is the health safety and wellbeing of our employees contractors suppliers and the communities where we operate.

While deployment of vaccines varied by region and country we also began offering onsite vaccinations in jurisdictions where it was possible.COVID vaccination education We make safe and sound work At Eaton safety is part of doing business right. A broad set of benets and programs create a workplace where employees and contractors working in our facilities share personal responsibility for creating and maintaining a safe work environment. It begins with our Safety Policy which guides us in our progress toward eliminating injury and illness in our workplace.The Eaton Safety Principles require each individual to be responsible and accountable for recognizing and correcting atrisk behavior or unsafe conditions. Every person in every Eaton facility is asked to abide by our core safety expectations. We consider these to be absolutes because a violation could result in serious injury or even death. At facilities around the world our safety expectations require employees to follow established safety procedures including hazardous energy control and machine safeguards work permits and specialized safety procedures for highrisk activities personal protective equipment as specied safe driving and reporting all unsafe conditions and all injuries and illnesses in order to prevent similar incidents or conditions occurring in the future. Our Environment Health Safety EHS Handbook provides requirements for working at or visiting an Eaton site. Protecting the health and safety of our employees remains our number one priority. We believe that all injuries can be prevented. That guiding principle is at the heart of our Zero Incident Safety Culture. Safety doesnt happen by accident. At Eaton we are continually engineering and implementing safer products and processes to keep customers and employees out of harms way.

1054,sustainability report,Sweco Annual and Sustainability Report Innovative tool calculates sustainability risks Climate change and increased incidents of extreme weather have a major impact on buildings. This was on display in the major ooding that occurred in the Netherlands during. For property owners this creates the need to understand and the ability to calculate the risks imposed by climate change when they invest in develop or lease properties. Working with property investor Vesteda Sweco developed KIM a software tool that species the risk of ooding and heat waves for the companys entire property portfolio along with initiatives that can be taken to reduce these risks. This solution gives Vesteda a deeper understanding of and the capacity to deal with sustainabilityrelated risks to all of its properties. Client Vesteda Country Netherlands Digitalisation of Vasakronans buildings Using Swecos Twinnity platform Vasakronan created digital twins of all of its buildings. The platform connects property data to a D model that visualises and analyses the data to determine how the building is constructed how it functions and how it feels. By gaining full control and an overview of all data operation and management can be optimised climate impact can be reduced and work methods and service offerings can be smarter and more exible. As an example the platform enables circular management by mapping all material that can be recycled and specifying its location. It is also possible to visualise carbon footprint indoor climate and supporting data for sustainability certication. Client Vasakronan Country Sweden Lidls rst wooden store in Finland Lidl is constantly working to reduce its climate impact. With its pilot store in Riihimki wooden construction is being explored as a way to create more sustainable store buildings. Sweco was responsible for overall design of the pilot store. Entirely new construction solutions were required due to the unusually large proportion of wood to be used. The result is a store built on a unique wooden structure run entirely on green energy with a circular heating system and its own renewable energy from solar panels located on the store roof. The wooden construction reduces the buildings climate impact per cent as compared with steel and cement. The solar panels provide around ten per cent of the stores electricity requirements and help further reduce its climate impact by nearly tonnes CO annually.,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0

Any material change in Spar Nords IT platform and IT systems is always based on a risk assessment that includes an assessment of confidentiality integrity and accessibility. Continued investment in IT security Spar Nord will continue to invest in IT security including in. The investments are driven partly by the increased risk of cybercrime and the dynamic threat scenario and partly by the fact that Spar Nord is designated a systemically important bank in Denmark. It is paramount for the publics confidence in Spar Nord that we maintain a responsible level of security relative to the threat scenario. With its continuing investments in IT securi ty the Bank is committed to complying with current orders issued by the Danish FSA.

1058,sustainability report,DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIONDiversity and equal opportunity are preconditions for a workplace atmosphere that is productive and based on respect and therefore are important components of successful employee management. The high importance Semperit places on having a diverse and inclusive workforce is reflected in the values of the corporate group. By creating appropriate framework conditions such as flexible structures employees are given space to adapt their work to their respective life situations. This enables the company to make an active contribution to inclusion. Semperit competes for skilled workers and managers. To attract the most qualified and suitable employees and to retain existing employees we must offer them an attractive work environment. Semperit uses several building blocks to achieve this The company has a wideranging programme of training and development and attractive career opportunities for example. The Mobile Working Policy introduced in includes a framework for more flexible work organisation and where possible working from home. Semperit also voluntarily offers its employees numerous social benefits such as a range of exercise options and additional medical services. Another essential component that not only makes the company more attractive but also represents a social value is the fostering of diversity and inclusion of disadvantaged groups of people. Diversity inclusion and mutual respect are part of the corporate culture. Semperit upholds these values in the existing workforce as well as when recruiting and hiring new employees.

1059,sustainability report,Governance and compliance A decent workplace Spar Nords most important resource is its employees. Therefore we wish to create attractive working conditions and a healthy and stimulating working environment in which all employees can unfold their professional and personal potential in the best possible way. It is important to Spar Nord that all employees are aware of their individual development and career opportunities and we consider dialogue and good management requisites for running a decent workplace. Spar Nord wants to promote a culture in which employees act responsibly towards customers colleagues the Bank and society in general. With that in mind Spar Nord endorses the UN Global Compact and has implemented a responsible working environment policy and a policy on sound business culture. Focus on telecommuting and flexibility While the pandemic in made telecommuting a temporary necessity was the year in which we drew on the best experiences from the periods of restrictions and lockdowns. Working from home and online meetings with customers and business partners have thus proven to be an attractive opportunity which several employees now make use of. As a result Spar Nord has prepared a new local agreement on working from home in close collaboration with the Financial Services Union Spar Nord Kreds and the Banks working environment committee. Among other things the agreement opens up for employees and managers to apply a higher degree of flexibility in the local planning of working hours. Obviously this has contributed to changing the existing routines and business procedures but in a manner where operations as well as employee wellbeing and health have been cornerstones. Furthermore surveys of health and wellbeing have shown that changing and flexible working conditions continue to have a positive impact on employee wellbeing. Going forward we will therefore be monitoring employee wellbeing and health closely consistently working to adjust our organisation and work planning processes to be well prepared to respond to future societal challenges. Organisational diversity Spar Nord believes diversity is beneficial for developing both business relations and collegial relations. Spar Nord therefore aims to strengthen its customer services and competitive strength by attracting as skilled employees as possible with respect to professional and human qualities.

1063,sustainability report,RA INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT LABOUR RIGHTS LABOUR RIGHTS EMPLOYEE SURVEY In October we conducted a largescale employee survey to help map current status and identify any labourrelated subjects that require more focused attention. The survey included questions about policy knowledge awareness of policy violations and how comfortable employees are about reporting violations discrimination and harassment. All RAs permanent staff were asked to complete the survey which they could do anonymously online. Our staff welcomed the chance to give feedback and shared lots of valuable insights that we are now using as a basis for our future HR sustainability and compliance efforts. The results of the survey showed that RA employees generally understand our company policies well and the majority feel they have had adequate opportunity to ask questions about them. However it became clear that not everyone knows how to report a policy concern or violation or what is classified as a policy violation and what isnt. This means we need to communicate more clearly on our reporting processes. It could also explain why we received very few reports that required action through our independent whistleblower channel in. We are therefore we are planning further training on the RA reporting process and the use of our whistleblower channel in. The survey also indicated that some of our employees experience discrimination and harassment in the workplace in spite of our best efforts and intentions. We are now taking actions to remedy this situation beginning with a study to verify the number of people affected and to deepen our understanding of the situation. The fact that survey data are filterable by location means we can target our efforts to address the challenges faced by specific groups in specific places. From now on employee surveys will be conducted annually in order to measure progress over time. For our survey we have decided to invest in a tailormade employee survey tool created by external specialists. The new tool will give us more detailed data to work with and will therefore provide a more solid foundation upon which to build remedial measures.,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0

Wherever possible we strive to remove consumer packaging altogether. We are also working on the implementation of a Product Lifecycle Management system which will allow us to monitor packaging data such as materials weights and measurements. Progress Continuous focus on reducing packaging materials Rusta has detailed the requirements for a Product Lifecycle Management PLM system Rusta has removed consumer packaging on highselling products Goals for the financial year We will use only singlewall corrugated cardboard for all Consumer and Retail Units weighing less than kg We will ensure that we gain full insight and optimal transparency with regard to packaging content in one PLMsystem Sustainable packaging materials An example of how packaging can support sustainability is the reduction of transport needs obtained by packing products more efficiently. This way we create less CO emissions. Furthermore we use recyclable plastics and replace Expanded Polystyrene EPS with fiberbased packaging material while preferably using one packaging material per item thereby avoiding mixed materials which is difficult to sort and recycle. Finally we use no hazardous chemicals in the packaging material. Progress pallets saved equal to containerstrucks All packaging sourced by the Vietnam office are Expanded Polystyrene EPS free When using corrugated cardboard instead of EPS we increased the filling rate less transports and lowered the total cost Goals financial year Rusta packages shall be EPSfree by Rusta shall have recycling symbols on all packaging Rustas yearly goal is to save in excess of pallets Smart packaging Rusta has developed a tool that enables us to calculate the ideal quantity of products per Retail Unit Packaging. This allows us to replenish products to the individual store once every second week instead on a weekly basis. As a first step Rusta will adapt packaging solutions to the pallet and container. Then we will work to further adapt product dimensions to pallets and containers. We are also working on new and improved guidelines on how to optimise packaging and handling of heavy products in our supply chain all to secure improved working conditions in our factories warehouse and stores.

1074,sustainability report,Our approach Reporting framework The UN Global Compact constitutes the overall framework for our reporting along with the UN SDGs that are the most applicable to our business. The UN Global Compact is a call to companies to align strategies and operations with universal principles on human rights labour environment and anticorruption and take actions that advance societal goals. Better Collective signed up in early and started reporting on the Ten Principles in the sustainability report. By incorporating the Ten Principles into strategies policies and procedures and establishing a culture of integrity we are not only upholding our basic responsibilities to people and the planet but also setting the stage for longterm success. Starting in we are implementing the SDGs in a stepwise approach. Our starting point in was to identify the SDGs where we can make an impact either through current activities or through new initiatives resulting in SDGs. During we made additional impact analyses and singled out two SDGs to focus on as a starting point. For now our eorts revolve around SDG on gender equality and SDG on decent work and economic growth. During the process of analysis we also dened KPIs and set targets to implement and report on both of which are presented in this report. As part of the SDG selection process we ensured that the SDGs are embedded in our corporate strategy and aspiration to be the sports betting aggregator in the world. We believe working strategically with these goals will support us in creating a longterm competitive edge.

CMP and our customers operate in the area where sea meets shore and we always strive to run our operations with minimal impact on the local environment. This includes preventive The work of protecting the marine environment is closely associated with two of the SDGs we have chosen to focus on Clean water and sanitation for all SDG and Life below water SDG .What we do to achieve clean water As a port CMP has a strategically important role to play in the longterm development of the seas in general and of Oresund and the Baltic Sea in particular. The operations water occur from ships in the port in the handling of solid or liquid shipgenerated waste or if accidental leaks from machinery or equipment occur. Prosperous and sustainable societies depend on access to good quality water and frugal water consumption as possible combined with strategic initiatives which contribute to cleaner water.In the area of Swede Harbour in Malm metal and other dry bulk products are handled which in the event of rain could leach out substances that risk contaminating surface water and the adjacent sea. To monitor this environmental risk we conduct regular chemical water analyses. We also have a treatment system where the surface water in the area is led to a ditch with a lime barrier where the water is purified both by sedimentation and filtration before being released back into the harbour basin. Although increased capacity and during the year we also evaluated the possibilities for a presedimentation step where we plan to carry out pilot project tests in .CMP continuously endeavours to be at the forefront with its use of environmentally friendly water purification techniques when dealing with contaminated water. The cruise and ferry quays in Copenhagen and Visby as well as the ferry quay in Norra Hamnen in Malm are equipped with fixed connection points to be able to receive and handle wastewater from the ships such as blackwater which is showers and laundry. Together with our Danish owners an investment is now being planned at the Langelinie cruise quay in Copenhagen to update existing technology at the connection points that contribute to a more environmentally friendly management of grey and blackwater with high concentrations of pollutants.

1077,sustainability report,Responsibility in the supply chain The social and environmental impact of Maersk Drilling extends beyond our own gates. We acknowledge that not all suppliers have the same starting point on issues such as human rights labour rights environment and anticorruption. Therefore our Responsible Procurement Programme has been designed to leverage our longterm business relationships and promote continuous improvement by partners in our supply chain. We want to work with suppliers with the lowest risk of adverse impacts on human rights labour rights the environment and anticorruption. Where there may be gaps we work with our suppliers to make improvements. Maersk Drilling has defined a number of highrisk categories which guide our supplier assessment and due diligence. The categories are depicted to the right. Our Responsible Procurement Programme includes tools such as questionnaires desktop supplier assessments supplier audits and corrective action plans. In we conducted supplier assessments compared to in. The lower number reflects our efforts to limit the overall base of key suppliers with only a few additions in . The assessments have focused on human rights and labour conditions environmental management and health and safety. Corrective action plans have been established by the audited companies and nonconformities have been duly handled.Contractors In Maersk Drilling we hire local employees directly whenever possible. However when we do not have employment entities at the countries of operation which mostly applies to shorter contracts we use manning agencies to contract local employees. In these cases we contractually demand decent working conditions of our contractors. Our commitment to respecting and promoting human and labour rights is also reflected in our approach to contractors and we oppose all forms of forced and bonded labour child labour human trafficking and all other forms of exploitation. All our manning agencies are subject to risk assessments in line with our Responsible Procurement Programme. Highrisk categories have been identified based on potential adverse impact on human rights labour rights the environment and anticorruption. We work with these high risk suppliers as part of our Responsible Procurement Programme to focus our efforts on the highest risk and improve our suppliers performance on sustainability. Yards pose risks from the perspectives of anti corruption health and safety human and labour rights environment and climate as a result of use of heavy machinery chemicals and other hazardous materials.

The idea was met with great enthusiasm from potential students. As a first step we offered places to employees in South Sudan and in CAR on a firstcome firstserve basis for more details see page. The many advantages of investing in this type of training quickly became evident. Morale among our employees was high and communication between staff improved which meant daytoday operations ran more smoothly. In keeping with our purpose this initiative also contributed to lasting change since those who took the programme are more attractive to future employers. By providing professional growth opportunities we help staff stay engaged and motivated while also contributing to SDG Quality Education and specifically to target. Increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills. PEOPLE SKILLS DEVELOPMENT SKILLS TRAINING Our English lesson pilot project serves as a good example of the type of training opportunities we will continue to offer staff in and beyond. Since each location and department has its own set of needs challenges and opportunities we will not adopt a single companywide approach. Instead training opportunities will be considered on a casebycase basis bearing in mind the requirements of the business as well as the future employability of our staff. OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROMOTION One of the main reasons for training local staff is that it opens up opportunities for promotion. In and beyond we would like to see more local staff being promoted. We have therefore set an ambitious target to place of our local workforce into more senior positions over the next three years. Since many of our local employees join us as unskilled preparing them for higher positions is a big commitment involving significant time and effort on all sides.

1087,sustainability report,ANNUAL REPORT ON SUSTAINABILITY Tailings Stewardship WHY IT MATTERS The health and safety of our workforce host communities and the environment are fundamental to Freeports extensive tailings management programs. Tailings are the nely ground natural rock particles or byproducts that remain after the economically valuable minerals have been processed and extracted from the mined ore. Typically our tailings comprise a slurry of nely ground natural rock particles which are transported from processing facilities to management and storage facilities. We recognize a failure of tailings facilities and other impoundments at any of our mining operations could cause severe and in some cases catastrophic property and environmental damage as well as loss of life. OUR APPROACH Freeport has comprehensive measures in place to ensure our facilities are designed built operated and monitored to minimize risk to employees neighboring host communities and the environment. We have a strong commitment from our Board and executive management to provide the necessary nancial and technical resources to maintain the safety of our facilities and the integrity of our tailings management systems with a focus on continuous improvement. Our tailings management and stewardship program which involves qualied external engineers of record and periodic oversight by independent tailings review boards and stewardship teams adheres to applicable regulations and various national and international guidelines. The program also conforms with the tailings governance framework on preventing catastrophic failure of our tailings storage facilities adopted in December by ICMM. In as members of ICMM we supported development of and committed to working towards implementation of the new Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management the Tailings Standard. The Tailings Standard was developed through an independent multistakeholder process coconvened by the United Nations Environment Programme Principles for Responsible Investment and ICMM following the tragic tailings facility collapse at Brumadinho Brazil. Through our membership in ICMM Freeport played an active leadership role and provided constructive input in the development of the Tailings Standard. Formally launched in August the Tailings Standard is the rst global standard for tailings management that can be applied to existing and future tailings facilities. The Tailings Standard has been integrated into ICMMs existing member commitments and ICMM members have agreed that all tailings facilities with Extreme or Very high potential consequence ratings need to demonstrate conformance with the Tailings Standard within three years by August and all other tailings facilities within ve years by August. Freeport currently is advancing internal plans to meet this commitment. Also in Freeport chaired a subgroup of the ICMM Tailings Working Group to develop a guide to identifying and recommending best practices for the practical implementation of the Tailings Standard.,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

We want to ensure that our packaging complies with the requirements and expectations our stakeholders have in relation to food safety quality and environmental impact and we want to ensure our packaging complies with applicable legislation. WE WILL Follow customer needs and trends Make optimal use of our packaging materials Support an efficient deposit and return system and improve the quality of recycling of returnable packaging such as glass bottles Campaigns and new legislation have increased the focus on the importance of packaging for the environment where plastic is receiving particular focus. Our products are sold in different types of packaging e.g. glass and plastic bottles cans kegs foils and cartons. Aluminium cans are the primary packaging in which our products are produced. All plastic bottles are sold predominantly in countries with wellestablished deposit and return system while aluminium cans are sold worldwide. In Denmark we are part of a highly efficient deposit and return system Dansk Retursystem where a return percentage of more than is realised. In Germany the return percentage on disposable packaging is approx. today but with a target of a significantly higher return percentage. During Germany will introduce a deposit and return system on juice products. Denmark introduced this in . In countries where there are no return systems for disposable packaging as a producer we are dependent on the willingness of these individual countries to establish an infrastructure that enables responsible collection and recycling.

1109,sustainability report,Our contribution to sustainable development SUSTAINABILITY AT BOSSARD Bossard aligns its sustainability efforts with internationally recognized goals and standards. Agenda and the United Nations sustainable development goals SDGs are essential for sustainable development. The SDGs are closely linked to one another through their interdependencies. We see our greatest potential for impact in our core business and hence in relation to SDG. Our solutions make a significant contribution to the modernization of industry and promote resourcesaving production processes. Furthermore the efficient and resourceconscious use of all our product solutions is in line with SDG. The different measures within the Reduced Footprint focus area and the environmental requirements set forth in our Supplier Code of Conduct page also address the issues in SDG and . As an international business with local employees we create secure jobs for men and women equally with humane and nondiscriminatory conditions as outlined in SDG. Finally our Code of Conduct page forbids all forms of corruption and bribery in accordance with SDG. Recognized principles of business responsibility To further emphasize our commitment to maintaining environmentally socially and economically responsible business practices our CEO signed the letter of commitment of the United Nations Global Compact UNGC in March. Bossard thus joined a global community of nearly companies of all sizes that have committed themselves to the ten global principles of responsible corporate leadership. As a signatory of the compact we pledge to implement the principles in the areas of human rights work standards environmental protection and the fight against corruption as well as submit a yearly report on our progress. In return participation in the UNGC initiative allows us to benefit from the organizations expertise and its extensive network. Transparency as the basis At Bossard we aim to implement reduction and improvement measures in the area of sustainability efficiently and based on data. Before we set measurable sustainability goals we want to validate our data basis. To this end we developed a separate portal during the reporting year in order to collect and manage sustainability data. This data can then be analyzed visualized and made available to all our locations for further sustainability measures. In the future we will be able to display the most important key performance indicators for each focus area in a cockpit page. We also added another parttime position to the sustainability team in the reporting year. This position is intended to further support and coordinate the various initiatives and measures at the Group level as well as in the individual units. Because of our highly decentralized organizational structure we are able to implement sustainability projects locally without directly involving headquarters in Zug.

It was important to us to make longterm relationships to work together to give children in overcrowded underprivileged schools an initiative that would have a lasting positive effect. We partnered with a local school and charity who run a Saturday school open to children from schools throughout the local area to help children in key subjects. Weve also partnered with the Soweto Equestrian Centre and Soweto Cricket Club. After morning study groups of children are taken to each facility where they can enjoy learning new activities beyond the classroom. Over the last year as Covid shut down an already fragile economy the project has experienced predictable difficulties but weve supplied sanitisers and PPE for pupils and staff members of the Primary school to enable the school to reopen and Saturday lessons to resume. This is in addition to the nancial support we provide to the Saturday school including tutor expenses catering transportation costs equipment and the horse feed weve donated to the Equestrian Centre during winter months. Yet were hopeful that over time in conjunction with our partners we can reach the point where happily the whole of Project Naledi can become selfsufcient.

In all of our markets we are endeavoring as far as possible to ensure that people with disabilities will be able to enjoy barrierfree access to all facilities in the medium term. Austria Visually impaired users in Austria have the opportunity to switch the websites of RBI and ELBA internet to highcontrast colors making them easier to read. The web pages meet all standards in order to be read by screen readers. For people who have difculty using the website due to limited hand mobility there are now larger buttons and images. A further signicant improvement was achieved through Responsive Design. This means that the website is automatically modied to suit the end device. Another important measure is the Sensing Journey voluntary training that is provided to RBI AG employees. This is intended to help to improve their understanding of the concerns of people with disabilities and make it easier for them to meet their needs in connection with nancial products. Network banks One of the most important requirements is barrierfree physical access to branches and ATMs. For most of our network banks this has been achieved at percent of branches. At just four network banks structural reasons mean this is only possible in between and percent of branches. Ensuring that ATMs are tted with corresponding keyboards and headphone jacks for people with visual impairments is another essential requirement. A web presence including digital product information with the option of switching to highcontrast colors represents a further signicant improvement for many visually impaired people. The compatibility of digital publications with screen readers is also becoming increasingly important.

As well as an annual reduction in CO of at least. per cent this will be achieved by means of improved energy efciency per cent energy saving by a proportion of green energy of per cent per cent is currently not currently possible due to the shortage of available renewable energy in the Eastern Europe region a reduction in business travel hardly any air travel by and information measures for employees who are key players when it comes to achieving the environmental targets. Since CO emissions have already been reduced by per cent in Scope and Scope and by per cent in Scope. Overall Scope emissions have fallen by per cent since. This means RBI is well on the way to achieving the dened reduction targets by. COVID meant that was an extraordinary year. With more people working from home consumption at the ofce locations decreased signicantly. Consumption levels and hence the CO reductions are expected to increase next year. At per cent RBIs proportion of green electricity is above the EU target which stipulates that the proportion of renewable energy should increase to per cent by. The central tool for the implementation and further development of the environmental targets is the environmental management system in Austria which is operated in accordance with the requirements of ISO certied since . In addition greenhouse gases have been validated for RBI AG in accordance with ISO since. The Environmental Committee Group Sustainability Management Facility Management and Sustainability Ofcers at the network banks are primarily responsible for implementing the environmental targets and evaluating the degree of target attainment. The following distribution of the Scope emissions shows that CO emissions have been successfully reduced across all three scopes since. On account of its size RBI AG has a considerably lower carbon footprint than the group as a whole. It has also purchased exclusively green electricity since and continuously implements energysaving measures. As such there is limited capacity for a further reduction in emissions. The biggest action area at RBI AG is business travel while the biggest action area for the group as a whole is energy.

The corporate strategy team facilitates the development and execution of strategy across the Company. They accomplish this by applying rigorous frameworks and tools for strategy development and execution. These tools range from fundamental situational and contextual analysis for strategy development to Hoshin Kanri planning for strategy execution. The corporate strategy team also analyzis the portfolio of Siemens Healthineers to assess its strength and identify potential market adjacencies that could result in future opportunities for mergers and acquisitions. The Chief Technology Officer is responsible for developing our Technology Innovation strategy and for driving its execution. The focus areas of innovation are discussed regularly with the Steering Board Innovation and Finance Committee. Following the Hoshin Kanri methodology the management teams of the Business Areas Regions Business Horizontals and optionally the Functions are responsible for identifying their longterm breakthrough targets three year horizon and shortterm objectives yearly horizon contributions to the corporate strategy. Strategy teams within the Business Areas Regions and Horizontals also have the mandate to drive the development and execution of strategy. After the years objectives are developed the breakthrough target owners and subteams within each organization develop the highlevel activities and detailed action plans needed to achieve these targets. A set of KPIs with financial and nonfinancial targets is established to track the progress of strategy execution and create focus transparency and accountability. In a catchball process there is an open feedback loop in which objectives are cascaded down and activities are developed to directly achieve the objectives. This results in an aligned deployment of strategy throughout the different levels of the organization. Progress within the activities and on achieving the objectives is monitored within each Business Area Horizontal and Region on a monthly basis throughout the year. In each Business the financial target setting is facilitated by our annual operating budget planning process.

1144,sustainability report,RA INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT PEOPLE SKILLS DEVELOPMENT RA INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Our goal has always been to recruit and develop local people whenever this is practical and economically viable. Over the past two years we have identified opportunities to improve some of our operational processes and set about developing training programmes in key areas. While we also offer development opportunities to our permanent international employees we are currently largely focusing our People Skills Development efforts on our local staff as this is where we see the largest scope for upskilling. We also invest in local suppliers since this brings economic prosperity and stability and makes a real difference to local communities. Its a true winwin since local sourcing often also lowers our costs and reduces our carbon footprint. THE STORY BEHIND OUR LOCAL STAFF RATIO At RA our aim is to maintain a high ratio of local to international staff. This aligns with our overall desire to be a responsible corporate citizen and more specifically with our ambition to support localcommunities. From the outset we recognised the value of hiring and developing local talent. Over the past years we have steadily built up the necessary structures to implement this approach from country to country and project to project. However the diverse nature of our work does influence who we can hire and when. For example projects requiring unskilled labour led to the recruitment of more than local workers in Central Africa last year whereas a securityrelated project requiring xray technicians meant we could only hire those with international accreditation. On average we employed local staff in across RA. This is likely to change in as new projects tip the balance further in favour of localrecruits. Investing in the skills and development of those who work with and for us is not just good for our business. It also reduces our clients costs and has a significant positive impact on the communities in which we work.,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0

These technologies are critical to support the global energy transition needed to meet the Paris Agreements goals. OUR APPROACH As one of the worlds largest copper producers we understand our critical role in the lowcarbon energy transition. We are dedicated to supplying the global economy with responsibly produced copper which includes operating in a manner that manages and mitigates our GHG emissions and other climaterelated risks and impacts. Our climate strategy is founded on three pillars Reduction Resilience and Contribution. Reduction We strive to reduce manage and mitigate our GHG emissions where possible. In we built upon our initial public target to reduce our GHG emissions intensity in the Americas by per metric ton of copper cathode with an additional commitment to reduce GHG emissions intensity in Indonesia by per metric ton of payable copper resolving to achieve both by from our baseline. We also plan to develop two additional GHG emissions reduction targets one for our primary molybdenum sites and one for Atlantic Copper. Resilience We strive to enhance our resilience to both physical and transitional risks associated with climate change for our operations our host communities and our stakeholders. This includes working proactively to analyze and prepare for an increase in extreme weather events water stress and other climate change impacts while also supporting our host communities and responding to anticipated market and regulatory demands. Contribution We strive to be a positive contributor beyond our operational boundaries by responsibly producing copper and molybdenum that will support the technologies needed to enable the energy transition.

It is the only technology capable of producing gigawatts of hydrogen fuel cells using existing global manufacturing resources dramatically reducing the time to market and investment needed versus existing fuel cell designs. Hydrogen fuel cells generate electric power from an electrochemical reaction rather than combustion thereby eliminating carbon emissions from the power unit and producing only water and heat as byproducts. Point two of the UKs point plan for a green industrial revolution announced in November focused on Driving the Growth of Low Carbon Hydrogen and laid out a timeline of target milestones for hydrogen technology in the UK. Bramble is well placed to be at the forefront of the adoption of hydrogen as a mainstream clean technology. Highlights Pioneering hydrogen vehicles and pure electric company eets Bramble Energys PCBFC innovative lightweight and cost eective fuel cell is set to bring even further transformation to the mobility and automotive industries.

1177,sustainability report,Spar Nord Corporate social responsibility Corporate social responsibility Responsible investment Spar Nord offers proprietary and facilitates third party investment products for retail and business customers. Investment always involves a risk of direct or indirect cofinancing of activities which have an adverse impact on meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We therefore share a responsibility for ensuring accountability in proprietary and facilitated investments. We have defined responsible investment requirements in our own investment policies and for investments made by our business partners. Committee for responsible investment At the beginning of we became a signatory to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment UN PRI which are now the backbone of our responsible investment efforts and our development of responsible investment offers to customers. In we also set up a Committee for Responsible Investment anchored in the Banks senior management. The committee is charged with implementing our policy on responsible investment and the UN Principles for Responsible Investment UN PRI including monitoring the normative screening of proprietary and facilitated investments monitoring the exercise of stewardship defining targets and maintaining exclusion lists. Ongoing screening and stewardship As a large proportion of the investment products Spar Nord offers its customers is developed and managed by suppliers and business partners it is paramount for us that suppliers and partners meet the same standards for responsible investment as we do. Consequently we require that asset managers and unit trusts meet our own standards for responsible investment. In Spar Nord screened all portfolios in which Spar Nord has a mandate to invest on behalf of its customers. We carried out a screening of ESG issues and compliance with international standards and conventions and the results showed that we generally succeeded in selecting investments that perform well in terms of ESG and compliance with conventions. Our screening procedures thus only resulted in a few divestments and exclusion of stocks in our portfolios. Sustainable investment product In Spar Nord started to offer its customers the sustainable investment product BankInvest Global Equities Sustainable Development. The investment fund is an ecolabelled investment product with very ambitious targets for overall ESG performance carbon emissions and compliance with the UN SDGs. In Spar Nords customers invested more than DKK. billion in BankInvest Global Equities Sustainable Development. Spar Nord also collaborates with Bankernes EDB Central BEC and other banks on developing and launching customeroriented digital tools which in compliance with upcoming EU legislation for sustainable investment help customers define their own sustainability profile with a view to prioritising ESG issues when making investment decisions. Risks Spar Nord manages its own and its customers investments in companies all over the world.

Our values are rooted in respect including respect for the human rights of every single person who works for or with us. Our commitments to respecting and promoting human rights p. Assess and address human rights impacts across our business activities p. Improve workers livelihoods and protect children in our agricultural supply chain p. Enhance a culture of integrity across the organization p. Provide effective grievance mechanisms to employees and stakeholders Why it matters Recent years have seen increasing attention paid to the responsibility of companies to respect human rights in their activities and business relationships. Consumers increasingly want to know about human rights in the supply chains of products they buy and there is greater interest from investors and regulators in this area. We believe upholding the human rights of the people who work for or with us is essential to make our business activities and supply chains more resilient stable and sustainable. Our contribution Although our size and scale enable us to have influence we know that sectorwide and sustainable change requires collaboration with others. We work with expert organizations such as the Danish Institute for Human Rights DIHR the Fair Labor Association the International Cocoa Initiative Verit Issara Institute The Forest Trust and ProForest to ensure we understand the challenges and we continually refine our approach to implement actions that have real impact. With the DIHR we identified our most salient human rights issues those with the greatest risk of negative impact on people within our activities. Specific action plans address these issues ensuring human rights are respected and promoted across our business activities. In recent years we have mainstreamed human rights work into our activities and policies. This has been extended with the adoption of our new CARE Audit Protocol. We have reviewed its content based on the lessons learned over the last few years as part of our Human Rights Due Diligence Program and in particular through human rights impact assessments. As we progress on our human rights journey we will also shift the focus onto our supply chain in future years as this is clearly where the most salient human rights issues e.g. child and forced labor are found.

Since then the volume of sustainable investments has increased nineteenfold. The dynamic growth trend continued unabated in. Development of the sustainable fund volume since In Raiffeisen KAG signicantly expanded its disclosure on sustainability at company and product level in order to comply with the new Sustainability Disclosure Regulation. Sustainability risks are taken into account in all funds managed by Raiffeisen KAG. These risks are factored into investment decisions as part of the riskreturn evaluation of each investment. The associated environmental and reputational risks for companies and issuers e.g. as a result of calls to boycott products due to violations of human rights are a major aspect of sustainability risks. Using various information channels such as media and research agencies the fund management team constantly monitors whether an investment is having a reputationdamaging effect. Depending on the assessment of the risk the securities are sold a company engagement activity is initiated and in serious cases the securities are excluded from all funds managed by the management company. The sustainability risks are assessed and monitored by the Risk Management department independently of the fund management team including the use of external data. Sustainability scores and sustainability indicators such as CO emissions can be used here. The relevant processes and the assessment of the sustainability risk are set out in the brochure and in the information for investors as per section of the Austrian Alternative Investment Fund Managers Act AIFMG precontractual documents.

With increasingly extreme weather patterns already seriously impacting our planet the time for decisive collective action is now. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC has called for global warming to be limited to.C. It is widely agreed that ambitious policy changes and collective actions are needed to achieve this limit. As a global company we are harnessing our scale and reach to inuence longterm engagement in climate policy both within and outside our organization. What we achieved We have been uncompromising in our commitment to reduce climate impacts leading by example in identifying pioneering solutions. Our determination has resulted in signicant emissions reductions. We have surpassed our goals achieving a decrease in direct and indirect emissions per tonne of product since. of all our electricity purchased came from renewable sources. Several of our markets even achieved renewable electricity. We are also addressing impacts outside the direct operations of Nestl. For example we are joining forces with other leading companies to advocate for a greener EU trucking industry. Our work on acting on climate change contributes to the following SDGs How we map our material issues to the UN SDGs saw us prepare and publish even more ambitious goals and strategies to direct our eorts. As a member of the newly established Race to Zero coalition we are joining global leaders in the challenge to achieve net zero emissions no later than. In December we completed a major study to better understand how we can achieve this goal. The data collected was then used to formulate new targets which we have publicly committed to.Looking ahead Our goals outline where we want to be by. Our Net Zero Roadmap which was launched in December with targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative SBTi is how we will get there. Historically we have focused on emissions that are produced within our own factories Scope as well as those related to the electricity we purchase and use in our facilities Scope. To achieve net zero emissions by we must now address emissions throughout our value chain. As the vast majority of our emissions come from activities in our supply chain Scope that is where we must focus eorts collaborating with various partners to achieve our goals.

1224,sustainability report,Details of nancing with a positive impact on the environment and the climate are shown below. RBI has further enhanced its lending policy concerning renewable energy projects across all areas of the Group with a particular focus on wind farms and photovoltaic power plants. Although there remains pentup demand for renewable energy in RBIs markets in Central and Eastern Europe an increase in the share of renewable energy is dependent on governmentimposed conditions in many markets. Most new projects can be implemented only with the help of guaranteed feedin rates. When it comes to nancing the bank is responsible for carefully examining the operational security of a project in order to keep the risk low. The reliability of political players plays an important role but is not sufciently ensured in all regions. This is why we have adopted a rule whereby we concentrate only on those projects whose feasibility is not dependent on special grants or feedin remuneration. In RBI had a nancing volume of around million in the area of renewable energies Sustainable real estate nance is the most important asset category in our green bond portfolio. However real estate that fails to comply with the strict rules of the Green Bond Framework e.g. due to certication that falls below the required standards can still be classied as sustainable. Around per cent of RBIs green building portfolio corresponds to our framework denition for our green bond issues. Around. per cent of these projects have BREEAM Excellent certication. per cent have BREEAM Outstanding certication. per cent have BREEAM Very Good certication and. per cent have DGNB Gold or Platinum certication.. per cent of the sustainable buildings have LEED Gold certication while. per cent have LEED Platinum certication.

The unsorted component of the waste collected is destined for various disposal metho ds searching for the best use of the waste resource that sees energy recovery through waste to energy as the most effective solution from an environmental point of view. The Group has structured some plants for the preventive mechanical sorting process w ith the goal of intercepting a wet fraction of waste that is rich in organic material and which can be stabilised biologically. DESTINATION OF MANAGED WASTE of the waste managed by the Group in was destined for the material recovery chain in Group and third party plants. WASTE SENT FOR MATERIAL RECOVERY Approximately tons consist of hazardous waste equal to. of the total. of the portion of the waste that could not be recovered as a material was sent for energy recovery and the remainder representing. of the total waste managed for disposal. WASTE DISPOSED Approximately tons consist of hazardous waste equal to of the total. No waste has been sent for incineration with out energy recovery. In its Business Plan to the Group has demonstrated its growing commitment to closing the circular economy cycle conceiving investments in several new plants for the recovery of the organic fraction with the production of compo st and biomethane for the recovery of paper plastic and wood with the production of materials that are reintroduced onto the market. PLASTIC RECOVERY WITH I.BLU I.Blu through its plants in Costa di Rovigo and in San Giorgio di Nogaro UD expected to be operational by transforms mixed plastics deriving from the sorted waste collection into Blupolymer and the secondary reducing agent Bluair the former consists of a recycled plastic granule with multiple uses such as the construction of buildings and resistant infrastructures containers and bags for sorted waste collection and many other objects the latter is a techno polymer designed for the steel industry which acts as a reducing agent replacing fossil fuel and significantly improving efficiency and environmental impact. One of the Group s primary medium and long term objectives is to increase waste recovery capacity in its own plants this is expected to reach. million tons in and around million tons in. In thanks to the acquisition of the I.Blu plants and the complete consolidation of the operations that took place during CMT and Ferrania Ecologia the amount of waste treated in Group plants increased by compared to. was also the year of the launch of Just I ren a digitalisation project that will make the management of waste collection services increasingly efficient.

Due to the rapid development of our company and the dynamic environments in which we operate our strategy is to look at a cross section of representative locations from which we can gauge our overall carbon footprint. RESULTSMost of our greenhouse gas emissions continue to be Scope indirect emissions that occur in our value chain such as food and drink air travel and metal concrete and cement used in construction. Our single heaviest carbon hotspot is fuel for electricity generation Scope direct emissions. For more details on our and results see pages and .REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINTWe are constantly looking at ways to reduce our carbon footprint. We continue to adapt the menus across our kitchens to have a reduced carbon impact and are implementing innovative building techniques to reduce the use of concrete cement and metal. We recycle construction materials wherever possible. A good illustration of this approach from is our completion of an extensive runway repair at a remote location in East Africa where we applied an innovative method of reusing the old tarmac that resulted in a substantially lower carbon footprint as well as a more durable end result. The acceleration of remote working practises due to COVID has further shown how we can work effectively with less international travel and therefore we have halved our business travel budget for.ENVIRONMENTCATEGORIES OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONSGHG Protocol corporate standard RA examples SCOPE All direct emissions from owned or controlled sources Fuel used for diesel generators SCOPE Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy Electricity purchased for SCOPE All indirect emissions not included in Scope that occur in the value chain including both upstream and downstream emissions Food and drink air travel construction materials electrical equipment We deliver.

1234,sustainability report,Overall objective Being present across Europe and managing clients from around the world travelling is part of our everyday business. More and more we recognise the necessity to limit our travel activities and increase the number of online meetings where possible. As a result we reduce greenhouse gas emissions allow our employees to spend more time with their families and minimise the amount of valuable time wasted on travel. In the future inevitable business trips will be carried out using increasingly sustainable means of transport. Boundaries This material topic is exclusively dedicated to employee mobility not to logistics and supply chain matters. Management approach To reach the overall objective we need to raise employee awareness on the environmental impact of travelling and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. To be able to reduce the number of business trips it is necessary to consistently collect data. At the moment the only groupwide data we have is the amount of fuel consumed by the companys fleet. We are working on a data collection system to get more insight to steer this material topic. Moreover we have a travel policy that is updated frequently. KPIs Quantity of fuel used for company fleet in litres Ad Blue..LPG ..Gasoline ..Diesel..SDGs UNGC Projects. Digital workplaces. Electromobility During companies learned how to handle business without personal meetings or at least with a very reduced frequency of meetings in person. As the entire value chain was affected the acceptance of videoconferencing grew tremendously. With various lockdown phases in different countries home office was also widely introduced and used by Schur Flexibles administrative employees. In the future we will offer more home office opportunities to our employees. Business trips will be reduced to a minimum.

1243,sustainability report,Sustainable nancing Sustainable nancing at the Vienna sites by RBI AG unless otherwise specied Financing with a positive impact on the environment and the climate The total nancing volume at RBI AG in the category of renewable energy amounted to around million as of the end of. This includes wind farms in Poland Romania France Turkey Bulgaria and Germany solar parks in Spain and Romania and biomassfueled power plants in Romania and Austria. In RBI also nanced the Green for Growth Fund which invests in renewable energy projects via nancial institutions and direct investments aimed at reducing energy consumption and CO emissions as well as increasing the efcient use of resources in Southeastern Europe Eastern Europe the Caucasus the Middle East and North Africa. In addition two new projects were nanced in Photovoltaic plants in the form of a constructionoperation lease model on free space at the sites of group companies and the expansion of a hydro power plant. Although there is still a signicant need for renewable energy in RBIs markets in Central and Eastern Europe an increase in the share of renewable energy is dependent on governmentimposed conditions in many markets. Most new projects can be implemented only with the help of guaranteed feedin rates. When it comes to nancing the bank is responsible for carefully examining the operational security of a project in order to keep the risk low. The reliability of political players plays an important role but is not sufciently ensured in all regions. This is why we have adopted a rule whereby we concentrate only on those projects whose feasibility is not dependent on special grants or feedin remuneration. We describe nancing as being sustainable when it has longterm positive effects on the environment and climate andor on societal and social affairs. With a majority of these nancing projects we support targets as stipulated in the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs within the scope of our capabilities as a nancial institution. Particular focus is placed on the following efforts Promote sustained inclusive and sustainable economic growth full and productive employment and decent work for all SDG Build resilient infrastructure promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation SDG Assuring inclusive equitable and highquality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all SDG Ensure access to affordable reliable sustainable and contemporary energy for all SDG and Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts SDG.

Where we have no reliable mains water supply we need to draw water from boreholes. We use water for kitchens laundry showers and toilets for our staff as well as our clients. We also use water for construction purposes as well as for irrigation but here we try to use treated grey water as much as possible. We follow strict operating procedures and only use WHO approved chemicals across our operations. All our sewage water is treated and whatever is not being recycled is drained into soakaways at no risk to the environment. Our goals in the area of water management are to increase the percentage of water recycled and to foster behaviour that reduces the use of water This is being achieved through upgrades of our water and sanitation facilities as well as initiatives to increase awareness and change behaviours around water usage among staff clients and guests. WASTE MANAGEMENT There are often no straightforward waste disposal systems when operating in remote locations. We carry out extensive research on how to safely dispose of waste while addressing the factors that generate of waste we produce we also reduce costs and our carbon footprint. Our goals are to reduce waste generation and to increase the amount of waste composted and recycled.Main initiatives in the area of waste include the reduction of singleuse plastics across our operations the building of composting systems alongside larger kitchens as well as investments into a new system that allows for a close to paperless interaction with our suppliers which has led to a drastic cut in the amount of paper waste generated companywide. ENVIRONMENTENERGY EFFICIENCY Given that we often work in locations with no reliable electricity supply we frequently have to generate our own power for lighting climate control pumps and electrical equipment. For that we largely rely on diesel generators and as such it is no surprise that fuel for electricity generation continues to be our main carbon hotspot. Looking at how we produce power and how it is consumed we have three main goals in the area of energy to increase the percentage of energy generated from renewable sources and to foster behaviour that reduces the use of energy This is being achieved through initiatives such as air conditioning upgrades the expanded use of solar water heaters continuous staff training in how to handle and maintain equipment and investments into renewable energy which involve a longterm strategic commitment. Where diesel powered generators remain a necessity RAs policy is to use multiple smaller generators that synchronise automatically with power demand supplying only what is needed and thereby reducing diesel consumption.,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0

1280,sustainability report,Tailings Management WHY IT MATTERS Eective tailings management is critical to mining safely protecting people and the environment and maintaining social license to operate. Tailings are the nely ground natural rock particles or byproducts that remain after the economically valuable minerals have been processed and extracted from the mined ore. Typically tailings are transported from processing facilities to management and storage facilities. We recognize the potential failure of tailings facilities and other impoundments at any of our mining operations could cause severe and in some cases catastrophic property and environmental damage as well as loss of life. OUR APPROACH The health and safety of our workforce host communities and the environment are fundamental to our extensive tailings management program and approach. Our objective is to have zero fatalities zero catastrophic failures and zero unplanned discharges from any of our tailings facilities. Freeport has comprehensive measures in place to ensure our facilities are designed built operated and monitored to minimize risk to employees neighboring host communities and the environment. These measures include substantial internal and external engineering expertise technological monitoring including remote sensing local responsibility and corporate and independent thirdparty oversight. Our safeguards generally fall within four categories that include good engineering practices and safe designs rigorous adherence to construction and operational parameters through monitoring and use of technology multitiered oversight and adherence to practices grounded in continuous improvement and learning from past experiences including industry failures and best practices. The safeguards are eectively implemented through the promotion of open and ongoing communication throughout the organization and action at all levels. We remain focused on the safe execution of our tailings management systems through interdisciplinary collaborations at our sites and corporate oces. We host workshops informational sessions and trainings for our tailings engineers.

As our climate changes so does the availability of water. Extreme weather events such as droughts and ooding are also occurring increasingly frequently. Although this is a global problem the impacts are felt locally especially by vulnerable societies. Water is a vital resource for farmers. Without it they cannot grow the raw materials needed to produce our foods and beverages. We are passionate about helping make the changes our suppliers need to protect this precious resource. We work closely with them to ensure water is used more eciently now and for the future. What we achieved Protecting water sources requires robust actions. Our commitments for water stewardship were ambitious from the start and we are proud of our results. We have reduced our direct water withdrawals per tonne of product by since. These savings have been achieved in part through robust water management something that our bottled water facility in Ontario California exemplies. In August it became the rstfood and beverage factory to receive platinumlevel Alliance for Water Stewardship certication. As well as minimizing our water footprint we support our local communities. Access to water sanitation and hygiene WASH services is a basic human right. With the arrival of the COVID pandemic WASH has become more important than ever. We extended a longstanding partnership with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies IFRC to secure access to clean water and sanitation in eight countries in subSaharan Africa. Our work on caring for water contributes to the following SDGs How we map our material issues to the UN SDGs Everything we have achieved to date supports our agship Caring for Water initiative and its four key impact areas Agricultural supply chains Communities Factories Watersheds Looking ahead While we continually reduce our direct impact on watersheds we realize more can be achieved through collective action and engaging all our stakeholders.

Moreover we seek to procure sustainable lumber and preserve forests that will lead to conservation of global biodiversity.Society in Which Humans and Nature CoexistMain ESG ThemesAction policies With. million trees planted annually we believe urban tree planting and the Gohon no ki project are growing in importance.Recent extreme weather events that are believed to be associated with climate change make peoples lives more difficult moreover they can damage ecosystems.In light of the decrease in green space due to urbanization in many parts of the world effective greening not only supports ecological conservation but also creates leisure spaces necessary for family life while revitalizing the area. Functional greening design supports healthy lives in various ways while also storing rainwater and reducing flood damage.However from the perspective of ecosystem conservation some of the horticultural and exotic trees commonly used for greening are difficult for local birds and insects to utilize. As well those not suited to the Japanese climate often have low insect resistance.Therefore since the Sekisui House Group has been focused on gardening and landscaping practices that actively incorporate native species likely to be accessible to local wildlife.Specifically we have implemented our Gohon no ki or five trees indigenous landscaping project under the slogan Three are for birds and two are for butterflies.

1357,sustainability report,Target Target Target Target .. Number of cybersecurity breaches Number of IT infrastructure incidents Percentage of IT and IoT assets securely managed by Security Operation Center SOC Incident response rate Due to digitalization information technology has been evolving to facilitate cloud storage. On the other hand the risk of cybersecurity threat becomes signicantly higher. IT system disruption and data breaches especially customer data can severely damage the Company in terms of finance reputation and customer trust. Therefore it is crucial for the Company to have a preventive policy in place to ensure business continuity. PERFORMANCEIn the Company experienced one IT incident. In November an infrastructure incident occurred resulting in temporarily suspending the accounting and nance system. However none of the significant information was lost. The Company was able to recover the system without signicant impact on the business operations. To upgrade system reliability and longterm cost management the Company initiated the project to transfer all applications to cloud service. It is expected that the entire project will be completed in. In addition to reduce cybersecurity risk the Company established the Security Operation Center to enhance its capability to timely detect any cyberthreat so that an immediate response can be taken. MANAGEMENT APPROACHThe Company announced the Information and Cybersecurity Policy based on the ISOIEC framework. By integrating cybersecurity management into enterprise risk management under the supervision of the Audit Committee. Leaks of customer data and cyberattack are considered as one of emerging risks. To ensure that cybersecurity is eectively managed Global Information Security Ocer GISO has been appointed to lead the data privacy and cybersecurity governance across the group with support from IT department of all business units. To ensure the same practice across all businesses the Company also develops IT security management standard. In regard to the standard when employees face any events or risks related to cybersecurity the person shall immediately inform the head of IT department in hisher own business unit and then further report to concerned parties for determining mitigation measures accordingly. In addition the Disaster Recovery Plan DRP drill for critical information such as nancial data is annually organized. The eectiveness of exercise is then assessed by a third party as part of ISO certication to ensure that the incident is properly responded. The Company also announced IT incident response procedure and established an investigation team. Such incident and response actions shall be reviewed and followed up by management monthly. To ensure privacy and the protection of all information especially for those of customers and business partners the privacy policy is introduced as a framework in dening the purpose of data collection disclosure of information and security of personal data. Cybersecurity awareness is one of topics in the orientation package and cybersecurity news is also regularly communicated to all employees via email.,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

Sustainability How wework ReUse A digital tool to simplify the sale and purchase of surplus furniture. Our goal is to influence and change our industry by reducing of the amount of office furniture delivered to recycling stations. Therefore we launched our platform ReUse. The office furniture market in Norway is estimated to be around. billion NOK each year. Simultaneously we throw. tons of furniture worth around million NOK where about of the furniture could be reused. Furniture as a fraction is challenging and expensive to repurposerecycle as they are manufactured and composed of several different materials. Therefore we want to make it easier to redistribute repair and reuse office furniture in a circular model. Reuse on a commercial scale can cause some significant challenges. First and foremost the business needs to know what kind of furniture they have what state the furniture is in and how much can be reused internally. This can be comprehensive and timeconsuming. The next step would be to sell donate or redistribute the surplus furniture to external suppliers. The logistics can be complex and seem overwhelming. The problems with reusing furniture can be obvious but the solution more complex. As the biggest player in the Norwegian relocation market we feel a responsibility to contribute to the solution. Our solution is the platform ReUse. An inventory and reuse system adapted and custom for mobiles for easy access and registration of furniture. Our clients register the furniture by marking them whit a QRcode which when scanned automatically uploads to a Dashboard where they have full overview of the furniture portfolio. Furniture layouts and the marketplace makes the process of buying and selling used furniture easier.

We wanted to know more about their sustainability and compliance efforts. Through this exercise we learnt that while the majority of our suppliers say they have a sustainability strategy in place few of them produce an official report or document the details of their policies. We learnt that most suppliers have good waste management practices and all have antibribery and corruption policies. Almost all of them have policies against slavery human trafficking and child forced labour. Around half have systems in place to reduce their environmental impact. Albeit smallscale this survey gave us a reasonably good understanding of our suppliers current efforts and will guide the way we engage with them in the future. In we plan to sign up as many strategic suppliers as possible to our new RA Supplier Code of Conduct. We will also request more detailed documentation of their efforts on social responsibility environmental practices and key policies such as Anti Bribery and Corruption AntiSlavery and Human Trafficking and Child Forced Labour. In addition we will encourage them to put more resources into measuring and reporting progress. POLICY TRAINING Our regular companywide policy training continued throughout with extra effort to ensure local staff were included. In the Central African Republic which is one of our most challenging locations from a travel and communications perspective a dedicated HR resource from RAs office in the capital Bangui travelled around the country to run training sessions for our local Frenchspeakingstaff. In addition we hired local bilingual HR staff in several of our countries of operation to assist with matters relating to local staff training and communication. EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN One particular challenge we face at RA is balancing the gender split among our employees. In of our overall workforce was female. Given the cultures we work in and the fact that much of our work takes place on construction sites this is not too surprising. Indeed we accept that RA is unlikely to ever achieve gender parity. What matters is that we continuously look for opportunities to redress the imbalance by recruiting women and implementing policies that level the playing field for female employees. Increasing the number of women employed across the company is one of our targets for and beyond. And we will not stop there. We also plan to start analysing how many women are employed at different levels across the company with a view to balancing up the numbers in executive and senior management roles. RA has a female Chair and CEO as well as a significant number of female staff in our office based locations in of our Dubai office staff was female and in our Nairobi office.

1378,sustainability report,CONSUMER We are aware of the global challenges regarding health and the WHO describes the challenges surrounding obesity and related diseases such as cardiovascular disease cancer and diabetes as well as alcohol abuse as a consequence of an overconsumption of food and beverages. We support the industrys work in relation to accountability and the authorities guidelines. Through the development of existing and new products we must be able to offer our customers more natural and nutritious products. We want to ensure that consumers can choose the right products based on information on labels and on our website. We participate in innovation collaborations where the focus is on reducing the calorie content of beverages. We therefore work continuously to develop and launch new products with fewer calories or less alcohol while maintaining the good taste and high quality. We know that consumers want more information about the products they eat and drink including nutritional information. We are therefore working to increase the level of information about products and in the financial year we implemented this in our soft drink range. Focus has continued to be on being able to offer a wide range of soft drink products as well as making a clear distinction between products with and without sugar. We have changed our light soda series to a sugar series. The entire Harboe soft drink range has been labelled with nutrient content per serving in order to help consumers understand how many calories each product contains. HEALTH We are constantly working on optimising our packaging methods. Optimisation of packaging methods takes place in close collaboration with the retail chains as reducing the amount of foil or removing foil completely can have an impact on the handling of the goods during transit and storage.

And while we have accomplished much of what we set out to do in last years ESG Report we did come up short with regards to one of our previous targets.Though we have not yet been able to achieve this particular target we will continue to pursue the following goal until it is achievedDuring we made full Scope emissions calculations for a number of GUBI products based on both spend and activity data. For products sold we have estimated CO emissions for over products primarily from the best sellers list. Using this data we have extrapolated to estimate the entire emission footprint for products sold. We hope that most relevant data gaps will be closed during the calendar year.

Our ambition is to ensure that more women progress into senior leadership positions. We believe that strengthening our pipeline of female talent and leadership on and offshore will increase diversity. In order to achieve this we aim to address structural and cultural barriers by Enhancing recruitment through awareness of biases in candidate selection and by applying a structured assessment process. Promotions through consideration of a broader and more diverse candidate field for leadership positions. Succession planning through identifying diverse successors with a special view to senior management positions. Acceleration programmes through putting a diverse selection of employees on a targeted career path. In we will initiate a process to further explore the cultural and behavioural barriers to diversity in Maersk Drillings leadership on and offshore with the aim of identifying additional responses to the diversity challenges. Our ambition extends beyond gender to include other diversity parameters such as nationality and age. Alongside these efforts we will continue to build awareness of the benefits of an inclusive culture through training and communication. Maersk Drilling does not discriminate based on age gender nationality socioeconomic background disability religion or sexual orientation.

Fostering diversity of thought is a critical factor for rms like ours that must mitigate risk and drive creativity innovation and client outcomes. The norms power structures and inequities in society can easily become embedded in any organization. We believe that creating a culture where every individual can contribute their full potential requires investigating the systems and processes within an organization to uncover blind spots and working to ensure an equitable approach. It takes conscious and sustained effort to cultivate a workplace where all employees feel valued included and able to deliver their best. Inclusion requires every employee to be selfaware and identify new habits and behaviors that successfully create a working environment that is welcoming for all and to take immediate action when theres evidence that this is not the case. At BBH we strive to understand one another by surpassing simple tolerance to embrace and celebrate the rich dimensions of diversity contained within everyonewhether those differences are driven by gender age race culture education disability socioeconomic background sexual orientation life experiences or many other attributes and experiences. We aim to empower every individual to deliver their best in a safe positive work environment.

1433,sustainability report,Activities and progress Employee satisfaction During the year employee satisfaction was tracked in all countries of operation except in Denmark. In this years survey some of the questions were slightly changed which makes the comparison with previous years more dicult. However the result is still satisfactory and above the Group goal of. in Sweden and Iceland. Strengthening employee wellbeing and satisfaction was among our top priorities in all countries during. In Advania Sweden there was a minor decrease in the result for both indicators. We believe that the reformulated survey questions in part explain the lower result and that the pandemic contributed to the decline. Remote working and reduced social contact with colleagues and managers have had negative eects on many employees wellbeing and sense of belonging. Advania Iceland has tracked employee engagement once or twice a year for more than a decade as it is one of the companys key performance indicators and the results are used to further improve employee engagement. Early Advania Iceland began conducting employee surveys quarterly. This way management gets more frequent information on how employees are doing as well as timely feedback on whether the changes made are eective. The surveys also make it possible to support teams that are struggling more than others and those teams get a more detailed survey in the next round based on their previous results. Advania Finland experienced exceptional challenges and lower employee satisfaction in due to integration and organisational changes and worked to improve the situation during. A wellbeing and work satisfaction program with a holistic and systematic approach was launched in early. The eorts included workshops and other types of training in selfleadership time management as well as health and good habits when working remotely. The health activities included both physical and psychological aspects as well as nutrition and worklife balance. Management is in crucial position to inuence employee wellbeing and satisfaction as well as driving their teams towards common goals. All managers also completed leadership workshops. Employee satisfaction surveys were conducted twice during and the result improved in June but dropped again in December. Advania Finland is currently investigating the reasons behind this outcome and is determined to improve the situation for all employees.

Specically this means ending all forms of discrimination towards women and ensuring that women can fully and effectively participate and that they have equal opportunity in taking on management roles on all levels of decisionmaking. In RBI set a Groupwide overall target quota of women on the Supervisory Board Management Board and in second level management of per cent by. The target at RBI AG is per cent. By the end of the quota had reached per cent for the RBI Group per cent and for RBI AG per cent. In addition to a threepart package of measures for achieving the target quotas the focus in was on breaking down the target of per cent at RBI Group level and per cent at RBI AG into annual targets for each board area at RBI AG. In addition gender diversity was integrated into the goals of the RBI AG Management Board members for the rst time. The Management Board members are responsible for dening target quotas for their own area of responsibility and developing a strategy for increasing the proportion of women in rst and second level management. To this end workshops were piloted in two board areas with Management Board members working with rst level managers and Group People Organisational Innovation to develop dedicated strategies and specic measures for their areas.

1442,sustainability report,Highlights Renewable energy In order to take important steps towards a sustainable future in the area of energy and also to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the longer term it is not enough to use energy more efciently but work must also be done on the composition of energy sources. In for example the construction of a photovoltaic system MWp output was evaluated for the Semperit headquarters in Wimpassing Austria. The implementation of the plant is planned for. The project serves as a lighthouse project in the eld of energy and the experience gained from it should lead to the initiation of similar projects at other locations in the future. In the Kamunting site was able to signicantly increase its efciency with regard to gas and electricity. The use of photovoltaics is also planned here for the coming years. The rst steps in this direction are underway. Target Development of energy intensity according of segments Target Semperex location Odry p.a. Semperform location Deggendorf p.a.

We do this by developing and deploying best practices and nurturing partnerships that make lasting changes. What we achieved We have scaled up our human rights eorts signicantly over the past decade. This has enabled some fundamental changes while actively raising the bar for transparency and understanding around child labor. In we became the rst company in the cocoa industry to introduce a comprehensive Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System CLMRS. In we became the rst to openly report child labor risk in our supply chain. Our landmark report detailed our eorts to tackle child labor and provided an honest insight into our successes and challenges. We know that child labor and other human rights abuses are exacerbated by rural poverty. That is why we take a holistic approach focused on securing resilience in the communities we source from. We have signicantly increased our eorts to improve livelihoods for farmers. This includes launching multiple living income pilots across dierent raw materials. We also continue to rene and improve our grievance mechanisms. These are a lifeline to help workers in our supply chain protect their rights and are essential to ensure our business partners are meeting our standards. In addition we continue to explore new technologies to strengthen our supply chain auditing tools. Our work on respecting and promoting human rights contributes to the following SDGs How we map our material issues to the UN SDGs Our Human Rights Due Diligence program drives our human rights work. This program will be kept up to date with revisions to dierent corporate policies standards and commitments to incorporate the most relevant and impactful human rights elements and language. An example of this is the updated version of our Corporate Business Principles and our Responsible Sourcing Standard. We have also conducted multiple impact assessments in atrisk countries trained hundreds of thousands of employees on human rights awareness and added new categories of data to our reporting. Looking ahead Expectations and best practices around human rights are evolving continuously. There will always be more to learn and new ways to engage with our employees farmers and communities. From transparency on child labor to training our employees and improving our grievance reporting systems we have achieved many signicant milestones over the course of our commitments.

1451,sustainability report,Relevant standards Sustainable Development Goals cial Partner of the Sustainable Stock Exchange Initiative SSE Euronext rmly commits to the UNs Agenda for Sustainable Development and thereby to the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs. The SDGs are a collection of global goals set by the United Nations General Assembly in for the year. They de ne global sustainable development priorities and aspirations for and seek to mobilise global orts around a common set of goals and targets. The SDGs call for worldwide action among governments business and civil society to end poverty and create a life of dignity and opportunity for all within the boundaries of the planet. They explicitly call on all businesses to apply their creativity and innovation to solve sustainable development challenges. The SDGs have been agreed by all governments yet their success relies heavily on action and collaboration by all actors. In order to make our ESG approach more transparent and to put it into a global context we have identi ed where the Euronext ESG impact areas set out in Paragr connect with the globally agreed SDGs. T ect we have selected the SDGs that are most relevant per impact area. We believe that out of the global goals Euronext contributes more in particular to the following SDGsTaxonomy Benchmark In addition Euronext as a Dutch listed company has closely followed the criteria of the Transparency Benchmark initiated by the Dutch Minister of Ec airs and Climate.

SDG CASE STUDY EFibers networks help level the urbanrural digital divide and contribute to SDGs Number Industry innovation and infrastructure and SDG Number Sustainable cities and communities. EFiber builds bre networks that bring much higher internet speeds to small towns and semirural communities that are often overlooked by larger providers due to their smaller size and the higher cost of investment thus creating a digital divide for these communities compared to larger cities. EFibers existence and investment in these communities reduces this urbanrural dierence providing these communities with the telecom utility of the future. The networks are open access to all Internet Service Providers ISPs thus providing consumers with many options when choosing an ISP while also facilitating the emergence of local ISPs who use EFibers network to grow their customer base. In EFiber passed an additional homes with new bretothehome FTTH networks in eight municipalities ranging from c. to inhabitants. EFiber generally connects all the households in a municipality irrespective of whether the home is in the town centre or in the more rural areas. In over local brand ISPs oered their services using EFibers network thus increasing consumer choice and promoting local entrepreneurship and employment. EFibers networks enable smart cities allow for more homeworking and reduced travel exibility and internetofthings devices in homes which can in turn provide for energy and productivity eciencies. Energy consumption of bre networks is expected to be signicantly less than equivalent copper networks reducing overall energy consumption. EFiber is actively engaged with the communities in which it develops FTTH networks and is a responsible developer. Prior to beginning a project EFiber works closely with the municipalities with respect to design and planning to ensure minimal disruption from the construction of the network. A close relationship with the municipality is maintained throughout development to make certain that the required criteria from the planning and design phase are met. Promotions are often done through local initiatives and groups which also contributes to the social cohesion of the municipality.

1463,sustainability report,The transition towards a lowemission society represents one of the most fundamental challenges that we face today. With more than years of societal development based on combustion engines and carbon based materials this transition will take time. With an expected rise in global population to almost billion people by there will be an increasing demand for access to modern services that rely on stable and affordable energy sources especially in developing countries. Most experts expect a significant rise in global energy consumption towards. The most rapid transition scenarios show that oil and gas will make up a significant part of the energy mix for years to come. While renewable energy will grow significantly to meet the overall increase in demand and to replace carbon intensive coal oil and gas are expected to account for a sizeable part of the energy mix towards. This entails a continued need for exploration and development of offshore oil and gas fields. Meeting this need in a responsible way is where Maersk Drilling can make an impact. Norwegian fields are leading in energy efficiency improvement Based on our longstanding leading position in Norway we are wellversed in some of the most demanding sustainability requirements in the world. The average carbon footprint from upstream activities on the Norwegian fields is around half the global average of kg CO per barrel and it continues to drop. There are examples of fields in Norway where the carbon footprint has been brought down to below kg CO per barrel due to the use of e.g. hydrobased shorepower. In Norway drilling for exploration and development accounts for approximately of total carbon footprint of the oil and gas companies upstream and midstream activities a relatively small proportion compared to the around coming from production platforms and around from storage and transport to onshore processing. Maersk Drillings ambition is to offer solutions that allow our customers the oil and gas companies to significantly increase drilling efficiency thereby reducing the total carbon footprint of each barrel of oil produced.

For openpit mine the average progress of revegetation was against a target of. In Australia the mine closure activities of the underground mines were progressed as planned. Moreover to ensure the eectiveness of mine closure management ITM a subsidiary in Indonesia had established the Mine Closure Committee. The committee arranged a meeting to review the performance on a quarterly basis. MINE CLOSURE It is a normal character of the mining business that the coal reserves will be nally depleted in every mining operation. The Company therefore places an emphasis upon the need to prepare for mine closure from the beginning and carries on throughout the mining life. This ensures that all areas are returned to a native ecosystem with the acceptance of related stakeholders. MANAGEMENT APPROACH The Companys mine closure standard is developed in line with the International Council on Mining Metals ICMM guideline and applied across business units. With an aim to minimize the environmental impact the standard encompasses several measures such as land stabilization waste management water management and mine rehabilitation. For each site the environmental impact assessment is performed and the mine closure plans are developed. The Company also monitors progress with reference to the mine closure plan.

1469,sustainability report,ANNUAL REPORT ON SUSTAINABILITY Climate WHY IT MATTERS Freeport recognizes climate change poses considerable near and longterm challenges for society and to our own operational and nancial performance. Mining is energyintensive and generates signicant greenhouse gas GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. However copper plays an essential role in the technologies needed to develop and deliver low carbon energy including solar wind and energy ecient technologies which are critical to support the global energy transition to meet the Paris Agreement on climate change. OUR APPROACH As one of the worlds largest copper producers Freeport understands its critical role in the lowcarbon energy transition. We remain dedicated to supplying the global economy with responsibly produced copper and operating in a manner that manages and mitigates our GHG emissions and other climaterelated risks. In we published our inaugural climate report established our rst GHG emissions reduction target for the Americas and committed to aligning our climate strategy and related disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures TCFD in the coming years. We also formalized our climate change strategy which is founded on three pillars Reduction Resilience and Contribution. Reduction We strive to manage mitigate and reduce our GHG emissions where possible. As a rst step in we established our initial public target to reduce our GHG emissions in the Americas by per ton of copper cathode by from our baseline. Resilience We strive to enhance our resilience to both physical and transitional risks associated with climate change for our operations our host communities and our stakeholders. This includes working proactively to analyze and prepare for extreme weather events water stress and other climate change impacts. Contribution We strive to be a positive contributor beyond our operational boundaries by responsibly producing copper and molybdenum for the energy transition. This includes collaborating with partners in our value chain with the ultimate goal of meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. To learn more about our approach to climate including our strategy please read our inaugural Climate Report available on our website. We also will be publishing our Climate Report later this year.

FOCUS ON EDUCATION KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND CULTURE For many years we have prioritised making our knowledge available to citizens associations students and classes at schools through various activities. This helps to create a dialogue about educational and business opportunities in the local community.

Through this we hope to be able to provide a better insight into Harboes history and the values that underlie all our activities. Every year we want to take interns at both companies primary school students and students in higher education for shorter or longer periods. This helps to give young trainees insight into the job opportunities in a production company and gives the students the opportunity to test theory in practice and through sharing new knowledge inspire the colleagues they work with at Harboe. During the pandemic we have not had the same opportunities but we look forward to welcoming trainees again. We look forward to continuing projects with students after the pandemic where we hope for good collaborations with higher education institutions and their students. We have had many good projects with students in recent years and we use the results actively after the collaboration and hope to provide students with a useful knowledge which they can also use afterwards.

CATEGORIES OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS as per the GHG protocol corporate standard As shown in the chart below most of our impacts are indirect. That means that theyre not actually caused by us. They occur in and around our business in our value chain for which we are indirectly responsible. CHALLENGES Construction is one of RAs three key service channels and as such its important for us to adopt a sustainable approach just as we do in the other two areas. However construction presents a particular challenge since it is by nature a highimpact activity. In we started working on a new holistic design philosophy with an environmental focus. It covers topics such as the selection of building materials fittings and equipment that improve operational efficiency and reduce both impacts and costs. At the start of each new contract we now engage clients in a dialogue and encourage them to consider climate smart choices that take the lifetime impact of their project into account. LOOKING AHEAD It is clear that the potential benefits of reducing our carbon footprint are not only environmental. Efficiency improvements invariably go hand in hand with cost reductions and therefore make sound business sense while mitigating impacts. Next year we will again measure our footprint at some of RAs permanent locations to track progress and look for similar projects to benchmark against those that have been concluded. Waste reduction SINGLEUSE PLASTICS During many single use plastics products were removed or replaced across the company. In the Dubai office for example singleuse cutlery has been replaced with washable cutlery and in Mogadishu our suppliers are now using reusable crates supplied by us for refilling with fresh produce. In Mogadishu Juba and Nairobi we have installed reverse osmosis RO systems so staff can now fill their reusable bottles glasses from the RO taps. In other locations such as Dubai and Bangui drinking water is supplied in large canisters that are picked up and recycled by thesupplier.

It is also necessary for mines smelters processing facilities and reclamation projects. Eective management of water resources can reduce the impact of mining activities on water availability and quality while respecting the rights of others. OUR APPROACH Water is essential to our work and vital to the longterm sustainability of the company and our host communities. We cannot operate without water and Freeport understands the critical importance of managing the impacts of our activities on water availability and quality and respecting the rights of our host communities and Indigenous neighbors. Freeports water stewardship program focuses on maximizing our water use eciency within our operations so that we can minimize our use of new freshwater taken from the natural environment. We are also focused on shifting our water supplies to more sustainable sources recycled reused renewable and lower quality sources minimizing negative impacts from our operations on water quality and availability in the local catchments and supporting the development of access to previously unknown unavailable or undeveloped water resources. In addition to focusing on our own waterrelated supply risks surrounding our operations water stewardship also means we are focused on promoting longterm water security for all. We recognize the importance of working collaboratively with our stakeholders to secure access to water in a socially and environmentally responsible manner and we are dedicated to continuously improving our water programs over time. The global nature of our operations requires a tailored sitespecic approach to our water strategy. Many of our operations are in arid environments where there is signicant competition for water.

Recently, anthropogenic pressure is performing challenges in the marine environment due to extensive marine fishing. Marine anthropogeomorphology, which can change the natural settings of the continental shelf dominant, is often not examined in detail from the perspective of sustainable catch. For example, the use of the different fishing lengths can damage the sea floor apart from the capture of young people and not targeted fish. The soil, which drags through mechanized craft as part of the sea fishing, affects the geomorphology of the continental shelf and continental slope by displacing boulders, interrupting the structure of the sediment column, resonating and shaping deep holes on the mud area.

If Kenya should not achieve hunger by 2030, efforts must be required to scale the profits achieved. Currently, the effects of climate socket, covid-19, grasshopper invasion and an economy that does not grow as expected, continue to worsen nutritional uncertainty. While it has achieved the long-term rainfall over the years, these profits are lost due to an economy that fluctuates and due to the violence after the 2007/2008 election and now even more because of Covid 19. This weak economy works a negative approach to access, not only for food, but also availability. It is estimated that by the end of this year many Kenyans will be unsure of food that need humanitarian aid. While the majority of Kenyans have access to food, it still cannot fulfill the recommended rations. Many Kenyans have access to foods that are affordable, which makes less and less nutrition. Although Kenya is currently an income industry with a lower mean, it still has an estimated 238,000 in the emergency phase. Dry and semi-arid countries have the highest food uncertainty. The change in climate patterns has led to poor performance of the short rains. Climate change has a negative impact on the already fragile situation of nutritional security.

The dependence of the modules parameters can be recovered by solving the equations of the ODS hierarchy associated with an infinite set of abelian symmetries generated in a recursive manner from the translations.

All the permanent Ras staff was asked to complete the survey that could do anonymously online. Our staff welcomed the possibility of providing feedback and shared many precious intuitions that we are now using as a basis for our future sustainability of human resources and conformity efforts. The results of the survey showed that RA employees generally include the policies of our companies well and the majority believes that they have had adequate opportunities to ask questions about them. However, it has become clear that not everyone knows how to report a concern or a violation or what is classified as a violation of politics and what is not. This means that we must communicate more clearly on our reporting processes. It could also explain why we received very few reports that required actions through our independent informants channel.

Our solutions make a significant contribution to the modernization of industry and promote resource -shaped production processes. In addition, the efficient and resource -conscious use of all of our product solutions with SDG.

In return, it enables us to benefit from the expertise for organizations and the extensive network at the UngC initiative. Transparency as the basis for Bossard We want reduced and improvement measures in the area of ​​sustainability efficiently and are based on data. Before we set measurable sustainability goals, we would like to validate our database. For this purpose, we developed a separate portal during the reporting year to collect and manage sustainability data. This data can then be visualized and all of our locations available for further sustainability measures. In the future we can display the most important important performance indicators for each focus area in a cockpit page. We also added another part -time position to the sustainability team in the reporting year. This position is intended to further support and coordinate the various initiatives and measures at group level as well as in the individual units.

We wanted to know more about their efforts of sustainability and conformity. Thanks to this exercise, we have learned that if the majority of our suppliers say they have a sustainability strategy, few of them produce an official report or document the details of their policies. We have learned that most suppliers have good waste management practices and that all have antibrical and corruption policies. Almost all have policies against slavery of the trafficking in human beings and the forced work of children. About half have systems in place to reduce their environmental impact. Although the small scale of this survey has allowed us to fully understand the current efforts of our suppliers and will guide the way we engage with them in the future. In us, we plan to register as many strategic suppliers as possible for our new Code of Driving of RA suppliers. We will also ask for more detailed documentation of their efforts on the social responsibility of environmental practices and key policies such as anti-corruption and anti-slavery corruption and the trafficking of human beings and the forced work of children. In addition, we will encourage them to put more resources to the measurement and the declaration of progress. The political training of our regular training on the scale of the company continued throughout the additional efforts to ensure that local staff were included.

In addition, we have hired local bilingual HR staff in several of our countries of operations to help with local training and communication issues. Employment of women A particular challenge that we are faced with RA is the balance of the sexual division between our employees. In our global workforce was a woman. Given the cultures in which we work and the fact that a large part of our work takes place on construction sites, it is not too surprising. Indeed, we accept that it is unlikely that the RA reaching gender parity. What matters is that we are continuously looking for opportunities to repair the imbalance by recruiting women and implementing policies that level the rules of the game for employees. The increase in the number of women employed in the company is one of our objectives for and beyond. And we will not stop there. We also plan to start analyzing the number of women employed at different levels of the company in order to balance the figures of the management and senior management roles.

SDG 10 was largely a reaction to the growing attention that was paid to the gross disparity of the wealth observed all over the world and to the political reciprocity to those disparities. Although it can be understood as a request for redistribution of wealth globally, it is unlikely that large -scale redistribution through taxation or other means is politically feasible as a solution to inequality soon. It is more plausibly interpreted as a request for a reduction in inequalities, those factors that prevent people and states from having a fair shot upon reaching prosperity and development. Within the national states, we can see this as a request for an approach based on the rights to development - an approach that tries to give people skills to be successful by removing also political and social factors, such as discrimination and repression, who prevent them from reaching their potential. Internationally, it is linked to the concept of development right, which places assistance obligations on states developed to help the poorest ones. International institutions such as the World Bank and the United Nations have the mandate to promote these rights and can act as intermediate institutions, lending credibility to this push for the recognition of development rights. The objectives established by 10 SDG are more vague and aspiration than those of most of the other SDGs, but the end of the loyal inequalities of wealth could be seen as a basic problem that makes many other SDG possible.

2162,paper abstract,"The livelihood of more than 30 percent of the total population in India in nine maritime states and four union areas depends on the various ecosystem services offered by coastal and sea systems. Due to the foreign exchange, marine fishing contributes significantly to the Indian economy from the export of seafood, which corresponds to almost 5 percent of the entire export and 20 percent of agro export. Recently, anthropogenic pressure is performing challenges in the marine environment due to extensive marine fishing. Marine anthropogeomorphology, which can change the natural settings of the continental shelf dominant, is often not examined in detail from the perspective of sustainable catch. For example, the use of the different fishing lengths can damage the sea floor apart from the capture of young people and not targeted fish. The soil, which drags through mechanized craft as part of the sea fishing, affects the geomorphology of the continental shelf and continental slope by displacing boulders, interrupting the structure of the sediment column, resonating and shaping deep holes on the mud area. Occasionally, the abandoned fisheries/gears on the sea floor are also responsible for the geomorphological damage to the sea floor and the death of several marine Benthischer Flora and Fauna, a phenomenon that is described as ""ghost fish"". In addition, the knot agency, which has been distributed since 1999, is illegal, not reported and unregulated with the help of remote-tensioned data sets with sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-A to reduce uncertainty during the sea fishing.

The change in climate patterns has led to poor performance of the short rains. Climate change has a negative impact on the already fragile situation of nutritional security. The increasing level of food uncertainty threatens to negate profits in Kenya's progress towards zero hunger. While the challenges continue to exist, the United Nations' World Food Program works together with the Kenya government to improve efforts to build up a sustainable food system that will ensure sustainability in food and nutritional security in Kenya.

This means that they are not really caused by us. They occur inside and around our business in our value chain by which we are indirectly responsible. The construction of challenges is one of the three main service channels of the RAS and, as such, is important to adopt a sustainable approach, as in the other two areas. However, construction has a particular challenge, as it is by nature a high impact activity. We started working in a new holistic design philosophy with environmental focus. It covers topics such as selecting building material accessories and equipment that improve operational efficiency and reduce impacts and costs. At the beginning of each new contract, we now involve customers in a dialogue and encourage them to consider the smart climate options that take into account the life throughout the life of their project. Looking to the future, it is clear that the potential benefits of reducing our carbon footprint are not just environmental. Efficiency improvements invariably go hand in hand with cost reductions and therefore make good sense in business while attenuating impacts.

As a rule, our tailings include an openings of natural rock particles that are transported from processing systems to management and storage facilities. We recognize that failure of tailing facilities and other pollution can cause severe property and environmental damage as well as loss of life in some cases. Our FREPORT approach has extensive measures to ensure that our facilities are operated and monitored to minimize the risk of neighboring employees and the environment. We have a strong commitment from our board of directors and the managing director of providing the necessary nancial and technical resources in order to maintain the safety of our facilities and the integrity of our tailing management systems, whereby the focus is on continuous improvements. Our Tailing Management and Stewardship program, which enlarges external engineers from record and regular supervision by independent Tailing Tailing Review Boards and Stewardship teams, adheres to applicable regulations and various national and international guidelines. The program also corresponds to the Tailing Governance framework to prevent the catastrophic failure of our Tailings storage facilities assumed by ICMM in December.

We wanted to learn more about their sustainability and compliance efforts. Through this exercise, we learned that the majority of our suppliers indicate that they have a sustainability strategy that only a few of them create an official report or document the details of their guidelines. We have learned that most suppliers have good waste management practices and all have antibri and corruption policy. Almost all of them have guidelines against human trafficking in slavery and the forced child labor. About half have systems to reduce their environmental impact. Although this survey gave a pretty good understanding of the current efforts of our suppliers in this survey and the way we will deal with them in the future. We plan to sign as many strategic suppliers as possible for our new RA supplier behavioral code. We will also request more detailed documents of your efforts to have environmental practices for social responsibility and key guidelines such as anti -bribes and corruption against anti -clavery and human trafficking and forced labor of children. In addition, we will encourage you to put more resources in the measurement and reporting. Directive training Our regular company -wide guidelines training continued with additional efforts to ensure that local employees have been included. In the Central African Republic, one of our most challenging locations from a rice and communication perspective is a committed personnel resource from the Ras office in the capital Bangui to carry out training for our local Frenchspeaking staff through the state. In addition, we have hired the local bilingual staff in several of our country countries to support matters in connection with local training and communication. The employment of women who have a special challenge at RA is to compensate for the gender separation of our employees. In our general workforce was female. In view of the cultures in which we work and the fact that a large part of our work takes place on construction sites, this is not too surprising. In fact, we accept that RA will probably not ever reach gender -specific parity. What matters is that we are continuously looking for ways to fix the imbalance by recruiting women and implementing guidelines that compensate for the competitive conditions for female employees. Increasing the number of women employed throughout the company is one of our goals for and beyond. And we won't stop here. We also plan to analyze how many women are at different levels in the entire company to reconcile the figures in management positions and managers.

Ecosystems are threatened throughout the region due to increasingly intensive expansion and agriculture, oil palm plantations and unsustainable rubber, fires, forest clearance, poorly regulated extractive industries, aquaculture and illegal trade in wild life. The total forest area has increased in Asia since 1990, but this figure hides the continuous loss of natural forests behind the expansion of planted forests, and subregional tendencies differ. Southeast Asia, for example, shows a greater rate of loss of forest coverage, as well as a reduction in biomass stocks, despite an increased area of ​​protected forests and stability in areas under forest management plans1. The number of threatened species of mammals and plants increased by more than 10 and 18 percent respectively in the last decade. Rural media are intimately connected and negatively affected by the deterioration of the health of terrestrial ecosystems. The drivers of the change in land use vary between subregions. The largest and most developed countries are more affected by large -scale agricultural development, while smaller countries, especially the developing states of the small islands, suffer from land degradation of small -scale activities such as the changing culture or urban expansion of population growth. The degradation of terrestrial ecosystems results in the loss of current and future benefits in terms of the multiple services provided by terrestrial ecosystems, even for rural livelihoods, reduction in disaster risk, water supply, food security and kidnapping of carbon.

The results show that OCPs have requested a global rule to reduce the sharp economic inequality in the context of an autonomous goal. On the other hand, the states part of the UN working group in SDG that frame inequality simply as social integration, which will be dealt with throughout the context.

In the nominal value, the goal carries a global transformation of a global rule, but this is misleading, as states have denied a target that measured the gap between incomes up and down. Combined with watered goals and indicators, this led to poor alignment between the title of the goal and its content.

SDGs mention only some political indicators and SDG2 in particular is largely devoid of political considerations to end hunger and achieve food safety. The Nobel Prize award Amartya Sen observed the absence of famine in democracies notoriously, suggesting that a democratic system provides checks and balances that prevent famine. His observation has aroused further debates and triggered empirical studies in recent years. Going beyond the hypothesis of Sen, this essay examines other political factors that would explain vulnerability to famine and which must be faced more explicitly in SDG 2 and similar initiatives. Taking the case of shepherds in the distant region of Ethiopia, this research explores selected political determinants of vulnerability to famine. The war of Eritrea-Ethiopia and the consequent closure to the borders had a harmful effect on the sustenance of the pastors away-twolls were deprived of a market and a reliable source of income. In addition, distant shepherds were set aside by the informal salty sector on which they used to rely. The state has facilitated this expropriation, leaving the shepherds even more vulnerable to famine.

The results show that the OSCs demanded a global norm to reduce vertical economic inequality as part of an independent objective. On the other hand, the states part of the UN Open Working Group in SDGs framed frame inequality simply as social inclusion, which will be addressed throughout the framework. The SDG 10 was included when developing countries, dissatisfied with the lack of inequality objectives between countries, joined the OSC. To the nominal value, the objective transmits a global transformative norm, but this is misleading since the states rejected an objective that measured the gap between the upper and lower income. In combination with diluted objectives and indicators, this led to a misalignment between the title of the objective and its content. This shows that despite the open nature of the OWG, the Member States greatly remained the most influential decision makers and successfully used a strategy of ""ignoring and focusing again"" to maintain politically sensitive proposals outside SDG10.

If Kenya wants to reach zero hunger by 2030, it will take efforts to increase the gains made. Currently, the effects of climatic shocks, COVID-19, the invasion of locusts and an economy that does not develop as expected, continue to exacerbate food insecurity. Although there have been gains on long-term rains over the years, these gains are lost due to an economy that fluctuates and was first weakened due to post-electoral violence in 2007/ 2008 and now even more because of COVID-19 This weak economy has a negative impact on access, not only for food, but also its availability. It is estimated that at the end of this year, many Kenyans will be insecure food requiring humanitarian assistance. While the majority of Kenyans have access to food, they are still unable to respond to the recommended rations. Many Kenyans have access to affordable food, making food regimes less and less nutritional. Although Kenya is currently an economy of lower-medium income, it still has around 238,000 in an emergency phase. The arid and semi-arid lands have the highest levels of food insecurity. The evolution of climate models has led to poor performance of short rains. Climate change has a negative impact on the already fragile food security situation. The increase in food insecurity levels threatens to cancel the gains made in Kenya's progress towards zero hunger.

However, copper plays an essential role in the technologies necessary to develop and offer low carbon energy, including solar energy and energy technologies, which are fundamental to support the transition of global energy to fulfill the Paris Agreement on the climate change. Our approach as one of the world's largest copper producers, Freeport, includes its critical role in the low coal energy transition. We continue to supply the global copper economy produced in a responsible manner and operate in a way that manages and mitigates our GHG emissions and other climatic risks. In we published our inaugural climate report, it established our first objective of GHG emission reduction for the Americas and promised to align our climatic strategy and revelations related to the recommendations of the working group on Financial Disseminations of Climater TCFD in the coming years. We also formalize our climate change strategy that is based on three pillars, reduction of resilience and contribution. Reduction we strive to handle mitigation and reduce our GHG emissions when possible. As a first step, we established our initial public objective to reduce our GHG emissions in the Americas by a ton of copper cathode from our baseline. Resilience We strive to improve our resistance to physical and transition risks associated with climate change for our operations our host communities and our interested parties.

Cities contribute to 70% of the world economy with proportional energy consumption and the consequent carbon emission. According to the World Bank, cities will generate 3.4 billion tons of solid waste by 2050, compared to 2 billion in 2016. That is, cities and communities are the most vulnerable taxpayers and the largest taxpayers to climate change , therefore, enough reasons to concentrate on the 11th UN SDG of ""cities and sustainable communities."" The SDG11 points to housing and transportable and sustainable transport; It mitigates extreme climates and natural disasters, the ecology of public spaces and the efficiency of resources; reduces the environmental impacts of cities; and improves the resistance of cities and communities. Without a doubt, growing consumption is similar to urbanization and modern forms of life, which makes cities such as the largest carbon emission taxpayers and environmental risks.

The ODS 10 was largely a reaction to the growing attention given to the rude disparities observed worldwide and the political reaction to these disparities. Although it may be understood as an appeal to some redistribution of wealth globally, it is unlikely that large -scale redistribution through taxation or other means will be politically viable as a solution to inequality soon. It is more plausibly interpreted as a request to reduce inequalities - those that prevent people and states from having a fair shot in the conquest of prosperity and development. In the nation states, we can see this as a request for a developmental rights approach - an approach that seeks to give people the capabilities to succeed, and remove political and social factors, such as discrimination and repression, that prevent them from to reach your potential. Internationally, it is related to the concept of the right to development, which puts obligations to assist the states developed to help the poor. International institutions such as the World Bank and the United Nations have a mandate to promote these rights and can act as intervening institutions, giving credibility to this impetus for the recognition of developmental rights.

Currently, the effects of climate shocks, Covid-19, grasshopper invasion and an economy that is not growing as expected, continue to exacerbate food insecurity. Although long-term rainfall has been gains over the years, these gains are being lost because of an economy that floats and was first weakened because of post-election violence in 2007/2008 and now even more because of Covid- 19 . This weak economy is negatively affecting access, not only food, but also its availability. It is estimated that by the end of this year many Kenyans will be insecure foods that require humanitarian assistance. Although most Kenyans have access to food, they still cannot meet the recommended rations. Many Kenyans have access to affordable foods, making diets less and less nutritional. Although Kenya is currently a lower income economy, it still has about 238,000 in the emergency phase. Arid and semi-arid lands have the highest levels of food insecurity. The change of climate patterns has led to a bad performance of short rain. Climate change is negatively impacting the already fragile food security situation. The growing levels of food insecurity threaten to deny the gains obtained in Kenya's progress toward zero hunger.
