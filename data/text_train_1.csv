1,paper abstract,"SDG1 presents the global community with an important, but highly challenging goal. When discussing tourism’s potential to contribute to SDG1 to “end poverty in all its forms everywhere”, the multidimensional nature of poverty must be considered rather than focusing solely on economic deprivation. Specifically, we need to shift the focus beyond how tourism can foster economic growth, provide jobs and income, to considering sociopolitical aspects of poverty and how structural inequalities are impeding people’s development. The contradictions involved in poor people, in poor locations, with poor labour rights, putting on smiling faces to serve rich guests of former colonial powers and to clean up their messes, should not be overlooked if we are genuinely interested in challenging the negative aspects of global tourism and making it more equitable and sustainable in the future. Thus, if governments and tourism industry players wish to do more than pay lip service to SDG1, they will need to make some significant changes to the way in which they work. This article will draw inspiration from tourism businesses in Fiji that are addressing SDG1 and related goals, and discuss how they have the potential to contribute to longer-term sustainable development.",1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

If Kenya is to achieve zero hunger by 2030, it will need efforts to scale up the gains made. Currently, effects of climatic shocks, COVID-19, locust invasion and an economy that is not growing as was expected, continue to exacerbate food insecurity. While there have been gains from the long-term rains over the years, these gains are being lost because of an economy that fluctuates and has been weakened first because of the post-election violence in 2007/2008 and now even more because of covid-19. This weak economy is negatively impacting access, not just to food, but also its availability. It is estimated that by the end of this year, many Kenyans will be food insecure requiring humanitarian assistance. While a majority of Kenyans have access to food, they are still unable to meet the recommended rations. Many Kenyans have access to food that is affordable making diets less and less nutritional. Although Kenya is currently a lower-middle income economy, it still has an estimated 238,000 in the emergency phase . Arid and Semi-Arid lands have the highest levels of food insecurity. Changing climatic patterns have led to poor performance of the short rains. Climate change is impacting negatively on already fragile food security situation. Increasing levels of food insecurity threaten to negate the gains made in Kenya’s progress towards zero hunger.

The SDGs mention only a few political indicators and SDG2 in particular is largely devoid of political considerations to end hunger and achieve food security. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen famously observed the absence of famine in democracies, suggesting that a democratic system provides checks and balances that prevent famine. His observation has elicited further debate and triggered empirical studies in recent years. Going beyond Sen’s hypothesis, this essay examines other political factors that would explain vulnerability to famine and that need to be addressed more explicitly in SDG 2 and similar initiatives. By taking the case of pastoralists in the Afar region of Ethiopia, this research explores selected political determinants of vulnerability to famine. The Eritrea-Ethiopia war and the ensuing border closure have had a detrimental effect on the livelihood of pastoralists in Afar – many pastoralists were deprived of a market and a reliable source of income. In addition, Afar pastoralists were sidelined from the informal salt sector on which they used to rely. The state facilitated this expropriation, leaving pastoralists even more vulnerable to famine.

We derive all infinitesimal symmetries of the self-dual gravity equations in -dimensional space–time and introduce an infinite hierarchy of commuting flows on the moduli space of self-dual metrics.

In developing countries, the EU is strongly committed to achieving SDG 2. The EU institutions and Member States, which collectively provide more than half of official development assistance worldwide, have reaffirmed this commitment in the new European 'consensus on development'. Alongside development aid, the EU has several levers at its disposal to act on food insecurity causes, such as security and defence missions and comprehensive strategies in conflict areas, as well as substantial research capacities.

Poor quality education has been reflected among others, in poor academic performance in school children, youth restiveness, juvenile delinquency and other anti-social behaviours predominantly in the youth, all of which are aspects contrary to the main objective of Sustainable Development Goal 4 priorities to realize the 2030 framework’s agenda of sustainable development. Using the case of the University of Botswana Faculty of Education Environmental and Sustainability Education unit, the chapter provides some insights into how teacher education can drive SDG 4 implementation through curriculum innovations and professional development to enhance education quality and relevance.",4,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

This paper explores the challenges of achieving SDG4 for Hong Kong in regard to ensuring equitable and quality educational opportunities for its ethnic minority young people, with a particular focus on equality in educational outcomes. The paper argues that school failure of ethnic minority students in Hong Kong is an educational outcome issue which poses significant challenges for Hong Kong to achieve SDG4. In addition to the Chinese language factor, there are many other interrelated factors at students’ individual, family, school and community level contributing to ethnic minority students’ school failure in Hong Kong.

This research asks the questions, does the data provided give an authentic understanding of the reality of education in Nicaragua?; and what needs to be done, in the case of Nicaragua, in order to best measure SDG 4? To answer these questions, qualitative and quantitative data was gathered from a desk review and interviews with Nicaraguan teachers to create a case study. The case study was then compared to the quantitative data provided for four SDG 4 indicators chosen by the researcher. Comparing the case study to the data, the results found that the data alone did not provide an authentic understanding of the state of education in Nicaragua. The results gathered that the data provided for SDG 4 was minimal due to the lack of political will in Nicaragua, minimal collaboration, inability to collect data, and the disconnect between the SDG 4 indicators and the reality of education in Nicaragua.

73,paper abstract,"So how can policymakers decide which of the five gender inequality indexes is best for tracking their country’s performance on SDG 5? Similarly, how do MNE executives select an index to track their company’s gender equality performance, at home and in their foreign affiliates? We offer three insights into these questions. First, we argue that there is no single right answer. Policymakers and MNE executives need to match their selection of a gender inequality index with the specific gender equality goals and targets they are trying to achieve. The “best” gender inequality index for one government or one MNE may not be the same for another where their goals and targets differ. There may be no “best” index nor “off the shelf” solution; it may be that a single index is not sufficient and will need to be assembled from different indexes. Second, policymakers and MNE executives need to understand why and how the various indexes are constructed; that is, making a “deep dive” into the selection and measurement of indicators and construction of the indexes. A thorough analysis of the various indexes is a necessary first step to selecting or creating an inequality index that best fits the organization. Third, our overall assessment is that, given their strengths and weaknesses, the GII and GGGI are better able to usefully inform policymakers and MNE executives on how to move toward SDG 5 in terms of workplace gender equality. For more holistic measures of gender equality that take account of women’s empowerment, policymakers must look to the new SDG 5 gender indexes.

88,paper abstract,"The paper describes the Global Water Partnership partner experience in the introduction of risk-based Integrated Water Resources Management , and water security. The concept of ‘sustainable management’, in the Russian version of Water SDG6, is translated as ‘rational use’ but no one can explain why. We suggest that such a misunderstanding happened since Ukrainian decision-makers still perceive themselves only as water users who are not obligated to achieve any development goals. Therefore, they are quite comfortable with the existing normative approach to water management where the objectives are compliance with defined norms and ensuring water security, which is understood as an absence of any water risk solely to humans, rather than the environment at large. Keeping in mind that true science starts with measurable values, and recognizing that you cannot manage if you cannot measure, we propose to change this false understanding of water security and sustainability that is inherent in the outmoded concept of ‘rational use’.

This target provides an opportunity as well as a challenge to African countries including Ghana. Indeed, the Ghana Energy Commission estimates that Ghana has about 34 potential hydro sites and enjoys about 330 days of sunshine annually. For instance, the three Northern regions, Volta and northern parts of Brong Ahafo have radiation levels with monthly average of between 4.0 and 6.5kWh/m2/day. These hydro and solar resources, coupled with abundant waste, wind potential of about 2000 MW and tidal potential can make Ghana a net exporter of power when the needed investment is provided.

They contribute to adaptation processes by contributing to reducing the vulnerability of people, improving adaptive capacity, and minimizing climate change risk in line with SDG 7. But these are not without challenges either. Financial, technical, institutional, policy and legal issues are major challenges to promote RETs. This study shows that theoretically altogether 4.45 million tons of CO2e of the GHG emission can be mitigated per year if all the remaining technical potential of deploying seven major RETs consisting of biogas, improved water mill, stand-alone micro-hydro plants, mini-grid micro-hydro plants, solar PV home systems, mud-ICS and metal-ICS were installed after 2012. Considering the average annual installation of these RETs, altogether 30.71 million tons of CO2e can be mitigated between the periods of 2013 to 2030 at an annual additional installation equal to average installation done in recent past three years. The initial technology investment required for implementing the above mentioned RETs ranges from NRs 97 to NRs 23,247 per ton of CO2e mitigation. This indicates that though a moderate level of the initial investment is required for promoting RETs, the GHG mitigation potential seems to be quite promising.

In the past few years, however, critics have objected to the basis for which it should be adopted due to potential negative trade-offs. Sustainable Development Goals number seven seeks to substantially increase contribution of renewable energy to global energy supply, as well as double the rate of improvement in efficiency of energy. Biofuels are likely to play a key role in the pursuit of these goals being one of the most advanced alternative energy sources. This review assesses the potential of biofuels to contribute to the set SDGs by presenting an appraisal of their development over the years. It sheds light on some main arguments surrounding biofuels from the perspective of proponents and critics alike. Even though biofuels have a great potential in aiding climate change mitigation, its large scale adoption is regarded as problematic in its current state. This is because of its potential negative trade-offs in terms of land use change and emissions, especially for first and second generation biofuels.

In this context, this study analyses the potential to embed the SDG 7 target of universal access to clean fuels and technologies into Indiaâ€™s national agenda. The analysis of the present paper shows that at the current pace of deployment of clean cooking technology, it seems unlikely that India will meet the SDG 7 target by 2030. In order to progress towards achieving this target, India needs to adopt a two-pronged technological approach â€“ access to modern cooking fuel needs to be increased alongside efforts to make traditional cooking fuels safer to use.

100,paper abstract,"SDG 8 calls for promoting ‘sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all’. Even as it highlights the importance of labour rights for all, it also makes visible some significant tensions. We note, for example, that despite many critiques of narrow economic measures of growth, the focus here remains on GDP and per capita growth. This is problematic, we argue, because the GDP productive boundary excludes much of social reproductive work. This puts SDG8 in tension with SDG 5 which calls for the recognition of the value of unpaid care and domestic work. There has been a significant increase in the rate of working women in the formal and informal sector. However, there has not been a subsequent gender shift in the doing of social reproductive work. In this paper we argue SDG 8’s focus on decent work and economic growth is inadequate; that productive employment and decent work for all men and women by 2030 needs to take into account the value and costs of social reproduction.

This goal confirms the relationship that exists between decent work and well-being improvement. Specifically, the study focused on the assessment of private employers’ awareness on the SDG 8 and its implications for well-being improvement in Dodoma Capital City, Tanzania. The study adopted a cross-sectional research design. Purposive and random sampling techniques were employed to select the representative sample. Data collection methods comprised of surveys, key informants’ interviews, and documentary review with the private employers’ influenced by Autonomy and Decision Making Theory. A total of 100 individual private employers and employees were directly administered with questionnaires. Descriptive and inferential statistics, such as Chi-squire was used to test for significance of data and regression analysis employed to assess the impact of private employers’ awareness of SDG 8 on well-being improvement. Generally, the findings show that overall, 53.3% of the employers are not aware of the labour right due to lack of enough knowledge on the SDG 8. This is correlated with the employers’ unawareness of the SDG 8 which has influence on the protection of labour rights. The regression estimates on the impact of employers’ awareness of SDG 8 on well-being improvement indicates that the knowledge awareness and work experience among the employers were statistically significant. This demonstrate that the wellbeing improvement are mostly contributed by factors such as employers and employee’s knowledge and awareness of SDG 8 and work experience.

104,paper abstract,"SDG 8 covers conventional economic policy goals like GDP growth and employment for which governments established agencies compiling the relevant data long ago. Since many years, national and international research institutes engage in forecasting economic activity to provide guidance for economic policy. The goals summarised in SDG 8, however, go also beyond conventional economic indicators, extending them to inclusive and sustainable growth and decent work for all. Indicators reflecting a broader view on the labour market, like the “inactive population due to caring responsibilities” or covering information on “people killed in accidents at work” or the “work at-risk-of-poverty rate” now complement traditional economic variables. Some of these indicators, however, are published with considerable time lag and there is not yet an established regular forecasting process covering them. The lack of timely information became obvious in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the lockdown measures, necessary to confine the spread of the virus, did not only create a steep decline in economic activity but also had consequences on the amount of caring responsibilities within families, when schools switched from class room to digital teaching. In addition to the negative consequences for employment, the sharp economic downturn also weighed on working income due to the reduction in working hours or the partial income loss associated with short-time work schemes. The strong interaction between labour market data and the disposable income of private households creates synergies between the nowcasting of key and multipurpose indicators in SDG 8.

It is believed that sustainable industrialization, together with innovation and infrastructure, can facilitate a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. However, public financing of SDG goals has been inadequate and the sheer size of the impending SDG financing necessary to be deployed in sub-Saharan African countries to meet SDG funding needs necessitates exploring alternative sources of financing. The chapter summarizes the extant literature around the potential link between sukuk and SDG-9. It provides insights on how the Islamic bond instrument can facilitate a structural shift toward more innovation and technology-oriented industrial activities and resilient infrastructure by 2030 in sub-Saharan Africa. The study finds that sukuk presents a potent and underutilized option as a way forward for financing SDG-9.

Still, the primary outcomes come from the 2017 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, the 2020 Voluntary National Reviews reports as well as scientific literature. Unfortunately, there appears to be a lack of reliable SDG9 information available, and what exists is hard to find. In general, information sources often offer qualitative information, and quantitative data are scarce.

Disadvantaged ethnic and religious groups experience poor access to, representation in and outcomes from public services such as healthcare and education. As mechanisms for social participation and citizenship, public services are key to inclusive and sustainable societies. In this paper we present results of a systematic review on strategies for the inclusion of minority ethnic and religious communities, often neglected populations in term of sustainable development activity. We focus on four public service areas: education, health, local government and police services and identify evidence gaps. Our overall aim is to raise awareness and provoke debate, reflection and subsequently action towards the inclusion of disadvantaged ethnic and religious minorities within public services. Public service inclusion strategies were identified through a global evidence review and four country specific reviews conducted by the Socially Inclusive Cities Network - academics, NGOs, policy - makers and practitioners from India, Kenya, Nigeria, Vietnam and the UK. Published evidence was supplemented by country-based and international workshops involving over 230 relevant stakeholders. We specifically explored intersectional experience relating to gender, age and migration status. 56 publications were identified for the global review, mostly in health and education. Macro arena were identified as three distinct but interconnected levels through which exclusion is operationalized. Three overarching frameworks appeared key to successful ethnic and religious inclusion initiatives: accounting for social context; multiple strategies for system reform; and collaboration with disadvantaged communities. Inclusion strategies that address macro, meso and micro level drivers of exclusion are needed to achieve the aspirations of SDG 10.

122,paper abstract,"In response to growing political concerns about the rise in inequality within and between countries, the Sustainable Development Goals include what appears to be a groundbreaking goal to reduce inequality in the form of SDG 10. This study used desk research to explore what led to its inclusion by analyzing the negotiation process on goal, targets, and indicators. The results show that CSOs demanded a global norm on reducing vertical economic inequality as part of a stand-alone goal. On the other hand, the states part of the UN Open Working Group on SDGs framed inequality merely as social inclusion, to be addressed throughout the framework. SDG 10 was included when developing countries, unsatisfied with the lack of between-country inequality targets, joined CSOs. At face value, the goal conveys a transformative global norm, but this is misleading as states refused a target measuring the gap between the top and bottom incomes. In combination with watered down targets and indicators, this led to a misalignment between the title of the goal and its content.This shows that despite the open nature of the OWG, member states remained by far the most influential decision-makers and successfully used an “ignore-and-reframe” strategy to keep politically sensitive proposals out of SDG10. An exciting avenue to explore further would be whether the inclusion of SDG10 makes a global norm on reducing vertical economic inequality in the future more likely, and what would be needed to achieve this.",10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1
123,paper abstract,"Sustainable Development Goal 10, Reduce Inequality In and Among Countries, was among the last of the SDGs to be added. SDG 10 was largely a reaction to the increasing attention being paid to the gross disparities of wealth observed around the world, and the political backlash to those disparities. While it can be understood as a call for some redistribution of wealth globally, it is unlikely that large-scale redistribution through taxation or other means is politically feasible as a solution to inequality any time soon. It is more plausibly interpreted as a call for a reduction of inequities - those factors that prevent people and states from having a fair shot at the achievement of prosperity and development. Within nation states, we can see this as a call for a rights-based approach to development - an approach that seeks to give people the capabilities to succeed while also removing the political and social factors, such as discrimination and repression, that prevent them from achieving their potential. Internationally, it is related to the concept of a right to development, which places obligations of assistance on developed states to aid poorer ones. International institutions such as the World Bank and the United Nations have a mandate to promote such rights, and can act as intervening institutions, lending credibility to this drive for the recognition of development rights. The targets set by SDG 10 are more vague and aspirational than those of most other of the SDGs, but the end of gross inequalities of wealth might be seen as a foundational issue that makes many other SDGs possible.

Consequently, it has failed to fulfil the institutional and policy aspirations of Islamic economic system. This statement is investigated with an empirical study.

In recent years, there have been progress in national statistics and censuses survey yet data gathering in many African countries are not accurate, timely, disaggregated and widely usable. This often diminish the capability of governments to tackle urban development challenges, which are particularly exacerbated by inequality, poverty and uncontrolled development especially in cities. To support knowledge driven decisions and policies there is need to improve data-gathering systems about health, education, and safety, economy and poverty, land, housing and environment, trade and commerce, population and demography. Also, the underlying dynamics, processes, distributions, patterns, trends or disparities inherent in African cities require the breaking down of aggregated data into their component parts or smaller units, which underscores urban data revolution towards achieving SDG 11. In Africa, the process of bringing together diverse data communities to embrace a diverse range of data sources, tools, and innovative technologies, to provide disaggregated data for decision-making, service delivery and citizen engagement is still emerging.

Life cycle assessment, with its integrated holistic approach, is considered a reference method for the assessment of the environmental impact of production and consumption. This paper presents a study on the environmental impacts of final consumption in Europe in five areas of consumption: food, mobility, housing, household goods, and appliances. Based on the selection of a set of representative products to meet food, mobility, housing, and other consumers’ needs, environmental impacts of products are assessed over their full life cycle: from raw material extraction to production, distribution, use, and end-of-life phase. Life cycle inventories of representative products are multiplied by consumption statistics to assess the impact of an average European citizen in 2010 and 2015. Impacts are assessed considering the sixteen impact categories of the Environmental Footprint method. Results reveal that food is the most relevant area of consumption driving environmental impacts. Use phase is the most important life cycle stage for many impact categories, especially for the areas of consumption housing, mobility, and appliances. For the areas of consumption food and household goods, the most important life cycle phase is related to upstream processes, which corresponds to agricultural activities for food and manufacturing of products components for household goods.

It examines the Oceans Goal as part of the SDGs and considers in more detail the process of nexus thinking, in particular as it relates to the ocean-climate nexus. This highlights that there are risks in relying on SDG interaction analysis due to skewed results or a failure to accommodate rapid transformation or knowledge gain in certain fields.

173,paper abstract,"The livelihoods of more than 30 per cent of the total population in India residing in nine maritime states and four Union Territories are dependent on the diverse ecosystem services offered by coastal and marine systems. Marine fisheries contribute significantly to the Indian economy through the foreign exchange from the export of seafood which corresponds to nearly 5 per cent of the overall export and 20 per cent of the agro-export. In recent times, the anthropogenic pressures due to extensive marine fishing introduce challenges in the marine environment. Marine anthropogeomorphology, capable of transforming the natural settings of the continental shelf dominantly, is often not studied in detail from the perspective of sustainable fishing. For example, the use of the assorted fishing gears can damage the sea floor, apart from the capture of juvenile and non-target fishes. Bottom trawling by mechanised crafts as a part of marine fishing affects the geomorphology of the continental shelf and continental slope by displacing boulders, interrupting the structure of the sediment column, resuspending sediments, and imprinting deep holes on the muddy sea bottom. Occasionally, the abandoned fishing nets/gears on the seafloor are also responsible for the geomorphological damages to the bottom of the sea and death of several marine benthic flora and fauna, a phenomenon referred to as ""ghost fishing"". Further, Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated is the nodal agency, which disseminates PFZ advisory since 1999 using remotely sensed datasets of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a to reduce the uncertainty during marine fishing.

Ecosystems are threatened throughout the region due to expanding and increasingly intensive agriculture, unsustainable oil palm and rubber plantations, fires, forest clearance, poorly regulated extractives industries, aquaculture and illegal wildlife trade. The total forest area has increased in Asia since 1990 but this figure hides the continuing loss of natural forests behind the expansion of planted forests, and sub-regional trends differ. Southeast Asia, for example, shows an increased rate of forest cover loss as well as a reduction in biomass stocks , despite an increased area of protected forests and stability in areas under forest management plans1.

We suggest operationalizing the concept of partnership according to different levels of accountability and participation, allowing for a gradual enhancement of the quality of partnership in terms of ‘meaningfulness.’ We apply our analytical model to the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well‐Being for All , a fairly new initiative by health and development agencies to accelerate progress towards the health-related targets of the 2030 Agenda. By investigating the development and the early phase of implementing the GAP, we empirically assess if and how the notion of partnership envisioned in the GAP qualifies as ‘meaningful’ with respect to civil society engagement. From our empirical example, we infer lessons for attaining normative standards of ‘meaningfulness’ and highlight implications for future research on partnerships.",17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0

196,paper abstract,"Associated with this issue, one of the newly specified direct paths suggests there is a positive relationship between the communication of expectation and cooperation. This direct path was identified as most significant in the model. Communication was hypothesized to be mediated through trust. However, more specifically, when referring to the communication of expectations, trust as a mediating variable may not be needed. The scales that contributed to the communication of expectations were associated with formal written agreements and the explicit articulation of the expectations of the parties involved. When the roles and responsibilities are clearly defined trust may not be needed as a mediating factor. Within the case study, written agreements were not deemed as necessary between partners who already had a pre-existing relationship. However, when the large financial investment was required a formal written agreement was deemed essential. As previously stated, cooperation is related to the interdependence between parties, which is aligned with the management of expectations, through a willingness to share tangible and intangible resources.",17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0

Nevertheless, the exercise of corporate accountability is challenging as it requires stronger corporate capacity and commitment to respond to external stakeholders in alignment with voluntary regulatory norms. In response, corporate agendas are being significantly shaped by internal and external stakeholders that are employees, suppliers, and customers. Yet, an examination of the current status of accountability both as a historical trend and in current corporate agendas in selected cases shows an increasing gap between policy and impact.

In the early 2000s, Business Ethics was dedicated to helping the Businesses in need that are in these countries. However, owing to the strong backlash from critics, they have changed their focus into helping businesses that are going to help the most people develop. These policies have improved the quality of life of the people. However, this facilitation changes the norms and, in turn, harms some groups. In order to enforce the new policies in an ethical manner Business Ethicists have created a cost-benefit analysis, placing an emphasis on basic necessities. These concerns have become so great that Business Ethicists have created a new department called Development Ethics. Now, instead of simply helping developing businesses, international business developers have begun ensuring that the companies keep basic human rights in mind. This especially applies to countries where the laws are not so strict and allow for abuse to take place. These development policies now have to follow the criteria that Penz created, consisting of: security, empowerment, rights, equity, integrity, and cultural freedom.[10] The idea of providing people with human rights in order to facilitate business development can be seen through the rapid development of China in the last few decades.

543,wikipedia article,"With companies becoming more and more conscious of ethical practices, closely watching themselves to avoid scrutiny, a company's reputation has become a great concern. Ethical business practices are closely tied with reputation which makes it essential to follow ethical guidelines if a company is looking to build their reputation. In fact, businesses that develop quickly and successfully have tendencies to show honesty, impartiality, and service to all of their stakeholders. In order for a company to be considered ""ethical"", it must cater to the needs of the customer, keeping their best interest in mind. This will influence customers to make repeated purchases and lead to more profit. In order for a company to build a strong reputation with their suppliers, it is crucial for them to focus on impartial business interactions and developing long relationships. These relationships can lead to mutually-beneficial business deals for both the company and its supplier. With the employees, they must take their interests into consideration and facilitate teamwork as opposed to rigorous competition. This ensures that the company will keep their most loyal and dedicated employees for as long as possible. Funding for further development can rise when a company is able to develop strong relationship with each stakeholder individually, and ethically. This is based on the concept of reciprocation, which states how in order for social change to take place between groups of people, trust must be built between them through mutually beneficial actions. This can be supported through the results of a questionnaire study that was conducted on technology industries in GTSM and TSE.[12] In addition, in order for a company to practice business ethics, and ensure strong business development, it is essential to maintain a positive relationship with the environment. With concerns about the recent decline of the environment increasing, stakeholders have become more involved in efforts to preserve resources and a negative impact on the environment brings about risks of damaging stakeholder relationships.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

585,wikipedia article,"Quantum finance is an interdisciplinary research field, applying theories and methods developed by quantum physicists and economists in order to solve problems in finance. It is a branch of econophysics.Finance theory is heavily based on financial instrument pricing such as stock option pricing. Many of the problems facing the finance community have no known analytical solution. As a result, numerical methods and computer simulations for solving these problems have proliferated. This research area is known as computational finance. Many computational finance problems have a high degree of computational complexity and are slow to converge to a solution on classical computers. In particular, when it comes to option pricing, there is additional complexity resulting from the need to respond to quickly changing markets. For example, in order to take advantage of inaccurately priced stock options, the computation must complete before the next change in the almost continuously changing stock market.

During the same period, the Sumerian city of Uruk in Mesopotamia supported trade by lending as well as the use of interest. In Sumerian, “interest” was mas, which translates to ""calf"". In Greece and Egypt, the words used for interest, tokos and ms respectively, meant “to give birth”. In these cultures, interest indicated a valuable increase, and seemed to consider it from the lender's point of view.[36] The Code of Hammurabi included laws governing banking operations.

Hot blast, patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron.

In recent years, however, critics have rejected the basis for which they should be used due to potential negative compromises. The goals of sustainable development are number seven in order to significantly increase the contribution of renewable energies for global energy supply and to double the improvement of the efficiency of the energy supply. Biofuels are likely to play a key role in pursuing these goals, which are one of the most advanced alternative energy sources. In this review, the potential of biofuels is evaluated to contribute to the specified SDGs by submitting an evaluation of your development over the years. It illuminates some main arguments that surround biofuels from the perspective of supporters and critics alike. Although biofuels have great potential for the support of climate change, the introduction on a large scale in its current state is considered problematic. This is due to its potential negative compromises in relation to changes and emissions of land use, especially for biofuels of the first and second generation.
