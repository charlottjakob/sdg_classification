23,Building sharing and applying nutrition knowledge You are what you eat or so the saying goes. With a network of research centers spanning the globe our scientists are discovering more about the human body and the role food plays in overall health. Our commitments to building sharing and applying nutrition knowledge p. Build and share nutrition knowledge from the first days through to healthy aging p. Build biomedical science leading to healthpromoting products personalized nutrition and digital solutions Our work on building sharing and applying nutrition knowledge contributes to the following SDGs Why it matters Some conditions like obesity type diabetes and Alzheimers have common physiological factors that can be affected by but also addressed through nutrition. Foodrelated allergies and intolerances are also increasingly common. By building and sharing nutrition knowledge we can help more people live longer healthier lives. Our contribution Were constantly looking to learn more about how nutrition combined with active lifestyles can support health across all generations. We use the findings from our longterm studies into the eating habits of infants and children for instance as well as collaborations with leading universities research organizations and startups to improve our products and services. In we invested CHF. billion in our research activities. We also share our findings to further the cause of addressing some of todays key nutrition challenges. In the Nestl Nutrition Institute NNI shared our learning with health professionals scientists and nutrition communities through articles in NNI publications and conference presentations. How meal replacement programs could be part of the solution to obesity In a world where obesity and diabetes are at epidemic levels we trialed the Optifast meal replacement program to see if it was more effective at producing meaningful weight loss than a standard foodbased diet and lifestyle program. The results were hugely encouraging compared to those on a foodbased diet participants in the Optifast program lost twice as much weight and had greater improvement in blood sugar levels. The study started in February and we started sharing our results with the scientific community and healthcare professionals in. We presented our findings at several scientific congresses including the European Congress on Obesity in May the American Diabetes Association in June and ObesityWeek in November.

24,INVESTMENT DESCRIPTION EFiber is a growing FTTH platform in the Netherlands that develops builds and commercialises FTTH networks in less dense areas i.e. smaller towns and semirural areas of the country. EFiber operates as a wholesale local network provider and generates revenue by renting capacity on its network to ISPs who then provide highspeed broadband access to mainly residential end users. As of December EFiber owned networks in operation or in construction comprising c. Homes Passed at completion across municipalities in the Netherlands. EFIBERS APPROACH TO ESG EFiber is a relatively young and small company. Arcus has worked with the founder and CEO of EFiber to establish and embed ESG management and best practices within the business. Since acquisition by Arcus in mid the company has adopted policies covering ESG AntiBribery and Fraud Prevention Health Safety as well as a Code of Conduct. ESG reporting is now part of the monthly management reporting. EFiber is also committed to comply with the TCFD recommendations. EFibers networks help to level the urbanrural digital divide and thus contribute to the SDGs. EFiber builds bre networks that bring higher internet speeds to semirural communities that are often overlooked by larger players due to their smaller size and cost of investment creating a digital divide for these semirural communities compared to large cities. EFibers investment provides these communities with a communications utility t for the future. EFiber regularly holds townhall sessions to provide those communities and stakeholders with information to understand more about the benets of FTTH. In addition EFiber regularly teams up with local schools and education groups to sponsor digital awareness programmes and has been actively involved in promoting FTTH for educational facilities. KEY ESG EVENTS In EFiber engaged ERM to undertake an assessment of climaterelated risks and opportunities across the company. The main objective of the assessment is to understand where material exposures to these risks may exist understand the timings and drivers of related issues and comply with the above mentioned TCFD recommendations. Over the course of EFiber continued to develop new stakeholder engagement tools promoting the benets of FTTH to the community like recently becoming a proud partner of Bee Landscape West Brabant whereby sowing the roadsides with red and white clovers during construction of the bre optic networks EFiber will contribute to improving the habitat of pollinators.

32,Result of Code of Conduct Environmental evaluations FY FY FY Poor Average Good High Energy and emissions Supplier environmental evaluation Rusta works together with our suppliers to continuously improve our environmental performance. Without exception the environmental performance of all potential suppliers is screened and evaluated before they may produce goods for Rusta. Apart from our basic demand that all critical environmental hazards shall be eliminated or be handled in a sustainable manner we rate our suppliers on Rusta Environment based on the following five areas Wastewater Energy consumption Greenhouse gas GHG emissions Waste management Emission to air nongreenhouse gases In this process suppliers firstly conduct a selfassessment which is then verified or revised by our Code of Conduct evaluators. During the financial year our trained specialists have evaluated supplier factories in accordance with the environmental standard laid out in the Rusta Code of Conduct. As a consequence Rusta ended cooperation with one factory due to negative environmental performance.

33,A longterm approach As a nancial institution there are two areas in particular where we can make an important contribution to resolving environmental and social issues and to protecting the climate through our investments and by advising our clients responsibly. By introducing sustainable processes and offerings we not only contribute to creating a better world but also minimize our transaction risks. Countries and regulators often take differing approaches to achieving climate goals. Depending on the regulator this can sometimes lead to adjustments being made to legislation at short notice. We must therefore be able to react quickly and exibly or anticipate these efforts through our own measures. In light of the rise in regulation we are increasingly making use of external policy outlook platforms and working with organizations that specialize in sustainability regulation. A broad range of departments at LGT Group are involved in this process. They jointly explore the prevailing understanding of sustainability and in particular the sustainability risks across all processes and develop new projects to align the Group for the future. During the reporting year key projects included the implementation of EU regulations becoming a signatory to the PRB and preparing for future reporting in accordance with the TCFD standard. We also further rened our Sustainability Strategy. As part of our sustainability strategy we have identied eight SDGs to which we want to make an active contribution The progress being made on the implementation of our strategy is reviewed on an ongoing basis.

34,The effects of the climate crisis on the world such as fluctuating rainfall regimesreduced rainfall and temperature increases result in extreme pressure on agricultural production. These changes and fluctuations are disrupting the textile industry which provides income to more than million people around the world and directly affect production. The most significant environmental impact of the textile industry is the intense water use throughout the entire process from production of raw materials to the finished products and gradual depletion of water resources is one of the most critical risks that could affect the industry. Apart from water use intensity the textile industry is also one of the industries in which the most pollutants are released due to the use of chemicals in various processes such as dyeing. The textile industry must embrace a proactive approach and start identifying all environmental risks and opportunities and take all necessary precautions. In a scenario where such precautions are not taken it is estimated that the associated risks will cost the textile industry billion USD by. Calik Denim integrates its sustainability strategy Passion for Denim Passion for Life with its business model and carries out its operations as a responsible fashion company. Based on this strategy it is aimed to effectively manage the risks that could affect the denim industry and make the most of the opportunities.

Spar Nord considers reaching out to educational institutions and offering stu dent jobs to young people to be a social obligation and a business advantage. Throughout the Bank focused strongly on recruiting recent graduates within economics and finance as well as aca demia. We have implemented new internal rules for recruiting trainees making it more attractive for the local banks to recruit new talent. Among other things this means that newly recruited trainees are no longer included in various economic indicators which has increased the incentive to recruit locally. Spar Nord has a responsibility for and an interest in being a stimulating workplace offering good career opportunities.

45,CLIMATE ENERGY AND EMISSIONS HOW CMP IS WORKING WITH AGENDA FOSSILFREE FREIGHT HANDLING ACCORDING TO SDG CLIMATE ACTION Our work on SDG is closely linked to our goal of being carbon neutral by . We adhere at CMP to a concept dling where we will avoid adding a climate footprint during the actual handling phase. This has a special appeal for customers who have sustainability as one of their core values and we want to be the natural partner for them.As part of purchasing new machinery and planning our freight handling operations we always try to strive for the smallest carbon footprint possible. In particular we are looking at alternative fuels and are trying as far as possible not to opt for fossil fuels. One example of this is by replacing traditional diesel fuel with HVO. HVO is largely similar to diesel and can be used as fuel in almost all diesel engines available today both old and new. The great advantage is that HVO reduces the carbon footprint by up to per cent which is vitally important to us when we are working to reduce our carbon footprint and not least our customers carbon footprint.Our first step has been to introduce HVO fuel for our bulk operations in Swede Harbour in Malm where we largely handle dry bulk i.e. scrap grain and similar products. All our rolling stock such as wheel loaders and mobile harbour cranes now only run on HVO. The remainder of our machinery such as the quay cranes in Swede Harbour already run mostly on electricity during freight handling. However when moving or maintaining cranes it is still necessary for us to use diesel at present.The transition to HVO has been made seamlessly. Since April we have not refuelled our rolling stock in Swede Harbour with any fossil diesel. Running only on sustainable fuel has incurred an additional cost for us as a company but the gain in terms of environmental benefits and lower emissions is something that we at CMP are striving for.ALL OUR ROLLING STOCK SUCH AS WHEEL LOADERS AND MOBILE HARBOUR CRANES NOW ONLY RUN ON HVO Target.

Our support covers all areas of commercial and corporate law such as advising in relation to regulatory framework fundraising crowdfunding and debates on rights for minors. In the last months this support has been needed more than ever and we have worked with La Voix de LEnfants on a legal analysis of the regulatory framework regarding minors and the tracking application considered by the French government. We have also worked with the Association and more of their partners to collect and donate several hundred computers for local children. As many pupils in the Paris suburbs have been unable to keep up with their schooling the equipment now enables them to follow classes at home. And we work with the association on projects beyond the French frontiers. For instance weve been working with them to establish legal citizenship rights for children in India and South Africa so minors can access the rights and services to which theyre entitled. In we have made a commitment as signatories to the UK Collaborative Plan for Pro Bono and The Fundacin Pro Bono Espaa. For many organisations nancing legal support is simply beyond their reach.

We need convinced employees who are actively involved in environmental management. This is achieved through open communication training and the opportunity to submit suggestions for improvement in operational environmental protection. Laws regulations and ofcial requirements result in binding legal obligations for Heimbach which we implement at the respective locations. In addition it is important to us to continuously improve operational environmental protection and the sustainability of our actions. We will reduce energy consumption the use of materials and waste volumes and use water resources sparingly. In these projects we will make use of the best economic technology available. Our sustainability goals according to SDG are Operational waste managementAt Heimbach waste of various fractions is produced. We are responsible for the proper collection separation and disposal. This must be efciently integrated into the daytoday business making as much as ecological and economical sense as possible. For some types of waste we make use of the services of specialized companies. So long as our residues are not nally recycled and disposed of we bear full responsibility for them. Since the Closed Substance Cycle and Waste Management Act came into force Heimbach has had farreaching obligations and claims. The aim is to promote sustainable waste management in order to conserve natural resources and dispose of nonrecyclable residues in an ecological manner. In accordance with the principles of waste hierarchy our priority is to reduce or avoid waste. When we dispose of waste we take the highest precautions to protect people and the environment.

Sustainable car loans In Denmark cars drive an average of km a year severely affecting the climate and the environment. Against this background Spar Nord has launched a car loan that contributes to reducing the global climate impact through purchases of carbon credits and investments in carbon reduction projects approved by the UN. The loan can be taken out for the purchase of a new or used car irrespective of fuel type and an existing loan can be restructured into the sustainable variant. When a customer finances a new or used car petrol diesel or hybrid the average annual carbon emissions of that type of car may be compensated at a rate of through the purchase of carbon credits. In this way Spar Nord helps reduce the total climate impact from carbon dioxide emissions. At end the value of sustainable car loans totalled DKK million. Green housing renovation Some of Denmarks energy consumption derives from buildings and a substantial part of Spar Nords loan volume is for financing the construction or renovation of buildings.

For the coming year investments have been planned to help further reduce our energy consumption carbon emissions and water consumption as well as optimise our raw material utilisation. Moreover an energy management system will be launched at Harboes Bryggeri AS in Sklskr in accordance with the ISO guidelines a system that has already been implemented at Darguner Brauerei Germany. The implementation of this system will provide a detailed and costeffective data basis which in combination with increased monitoring will ensure a strong foundation for setting KPIs for future reporting. Part of the water supplies to Harboes Bryggeri AS in Sklskr are obtained from the companys own bores. The same applies to Darguner Brauerei GmbH in Germany. The water supplies of both breweries are supplemented by water from municipal water works. None of the production facilities are located in waterstressed areas but Harboe has a constant focus on the use of water resources and on investments to ensure efficient utilisation of water including recycling of water in the production process. Wastewater is also a focus area. The brewery in Sklskr has its own high capacity water treatment plant and in Dargun water is discharged to a municipal water treatment plant. Both breweries have collection reservoirs meaning that the discharge can be adjusted to suit the capacity of the treatment plant. USE OF RESOURCES Investments help reduce the use of raw materials and consumables and in addition our efforts in this field are underpinned by continuous process PERFORMANCE Optimisation project to raise awareness of water consumption.

We aim to support our host communities during the entire life cycle of the mine not only by managing and mitigating our impacts but also by providing sustainable benets that will exceed the lifespan of our operations. Further increasing automation and shifts in the global economy are changing mining methods processes and labor requirements. Collectively these challenges make it increasingly important for mining companies to work collaboratively with local communities to support them in developing the necessary skills and capabilities to adapt and succeed over the long term. OUR APPROACH Freeport works actively through engagement investment and partnership activities to support host communities in maximizing the social and economic benets of mining. Our work is focused on supporting our communities to develop the requisite skills to successfully adapt to technological and economic changes in the future to reduce their dependency on mining over the long term. By partnering to increase both individual and institutional capabilities we help create increasing resiliency allowing communities to better weather and adapt to commodity market uctuations or other economic disruptions that may have social impacts. Constructive dialogue is at the foundation of our relationships with host communities and stakeholders. Our engagements help to inform understanding of our actual potential and perceived impacts. They also help us build a localized understanding of what contributes to community welfare and longterm sustainability as well as mutually identify relevant social investment and development priorities to support any gaps. Engagements also enable us to share information about our own operational activities facilitate dialogue and build trust. While our community programs are tailored to the sitespecic dynamics of the operation and host community our overarching objectives in partnership with our local stakeholders are to build enduring trust minimize or mitigate any negative impacts from our operations maximize the positive benets support our communities in building resiliency and wellbeing over the life of the mine and develop the skills and capacity to thrive beyond the mine. Policies Programs Social Performance Policy previously called Community Policy Mandates engagement and collaboration with local communities to minimize and mitigate unavoidable adverse impacts while maximizing opportunities to deliver value from our presence. Social Performance Plans previously called Community Engagement and Development Plans Each operating mine site maintains a Social Performance plan updated annually which provides a strategic framework for risk management engagement and development assistance to the communities and neighboring stakeholders near our operations. Social Performance Management System The system documents and institutionalizes how we interact with our communities across our portfolio with the goal of driving strong consistent social performance and critical coordination communications and accountability across the global business.

85,HHs Sustainability Strategy Sustainability is a strategic enabler of growth for HH. Buildings are a signicant source of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions GHG that cause climate change. Hence building materials such as our AAC and CSU products are well positioned for longterm growth as they ensure energyecient buildings and help to reduce the lifecycle emissions of buildings. Our Sustainability Strategy was updated in and is based on seizing the opportunity for growth in sustainable building materials while mitigating the environmental social and governance risks that are present in our products and operations. To support this we have set a tenyear sciencebased target to decarbonise our operations and reduce the carbon intensity of our AAC and CSU products. We have also committed to achieving netzero emissions in our products and operations by. Details on HH GHG emissions and our sciencebased target are provided in the next section. HH is also a signatory of the UN Global Compact and supports the UN SDGs.

86,Rusta Sustainability report Financial year Transport and Logistics Incoming goods In close collaboration with our suppliers and colleagues in Asia we continuously increase the filling rate in containers and develop smarter packaging and loading solutions. Distribution to our stores Rustas central replenishment system secures that our products are delivered at the right time to the right place and in the right amount. The system helps us reduce unnecessary transportation of goods to and back from our stores. In addition flexible delivery route planning allows us to choose the most suitable delivery schedule for the stores. Moreover the warehouse management system ensures that every pallet is full all in order to ensure that our transports are filled to the maximum thereby minimising emissions. To avoid traffic and save fuel whenever possible we deliver all goods during the night. In the north of Sweden we utilise railroad for distribution of goods to nearby stores. Progress The average volume on pallets increased with last financial year which means Rusta saved approximately distribution pallets equal to truckloads Goals financial year Collect data on CO emissions for all Rusta transport providers Include elaborated environment goals in all the transport contracts Modern warehouse Rustas central warehouse located in Norrkping is as of the financial year one of the largest distribution centers in the Nordics. Our warehouse has the capacity to store more than pallets. Constructed in recent years have seen some major expansions made with yet another expansion planned for. To have one centralized distribution center means that we can collect all our goods under one roof. This eliminates unnecessary transports while improving filling rates which means that we can lower both environmental impact and costs. The location for our distribution center is carefully chosen to ensure Vicinity to the container port in the harbor km to reduce transportation distance vicinity to railroad to enable railway transportation both to and from the warehouse Vicinity to Rustas biggest market and easy highway access to minimize distribution distance To save energy the entire building is heated by geothermal heating. Moreover the warehouse solely uses LEDlighting. This reduces energy consumption by an estimated compared to conventional light bulbs. Furthermore a pickbyvoicesystem allows Rusta to save more than three tons of printpaper every year. For several years Rusta has worked hard to develop improved processes in the area of automatic stretch wrapping machines to reduce plastic use. Thus by using a thinner but stronger plastic film we save more than ten tons of plastic every year.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,val
87,Along with the EcoVadis evaluations and TfS audits the close links between TfS members are at the forefront of the cooperation. In addition to the stepbystep evaluation of suppliers the aim is also to address various challenges such as the offsetting and reduction of Scope emissions or the safeguarding of human rights and to develop solutions together. Each member is part of a topicbased working group. Regular meetings provide a vehicle for a professional exchange of views and ensure that the high standards of the TfS initiative are maintained and that work on the various remits proceeds consistently. Semperit has been represented in the Partnerships and Governance working group since which currently focuses on topics such as respect for human rights and quality assurance of TfS activities for example by developing goals and KPIs for management. Semperit is also a founding member of the TfS Singapore working group which aims to advance sustainability in the Asian region. TfS is relying increasingly on local working groups in order to take account of regional circumstances and develop specific solutions. This is because appropriate activities and measures can only be implemented with the knowledge and understanding of the local framework conditions and challenges. Consequently being part of the TfS network not only means purposefully driving sustainability issues forward but also being a pioneer in developing the highest standards that go way beyond the usual approaches and methods. TfS is not only a label that a company pays for or where a company can be a passive observer the member company is also required to devote human resources to it and to make a considerable contribution in terms of work to the network. In the first year of TfS membership Semperit has worked hard on further training and informing lead buyers in order to deepen the expertise within the company on how to ensure sustainability in the supply chain and select suppliers and integrate them into the TfS evaluation process. The first step was setting up the TfSbased EcoVadis platform for Semperit and creating the necessary processes. The second step involved defining initial internal goals notifying all the parties involved accordingly and delivering appropriate training. In of the purchasing team was trained with the help of various internally and externally led events. The training programme not only covered how to use the EcoVadis platform it also provided an understanding of social and environmental issues and how to identify and prevent risk. SUPPLIER COOPERATION Semperit has set itself the goal of carrying out more supplier evaluations and working with suppliers in order to promote sustainability in the supply chain.

88,The principles and internal guidelines of the Semperit Group for respecting human rights and for interacting with one another as well as the applicable social standards are defined in the Code of Conduct as well as in the People Policy and the Supplier Policy which are publicly available on the Semperit website. The revised Semperit Code of Conduct was published in and must be signed by members of management. By signing they confirm that they have understood and acknowledge the Code and that they will duly report all possible incidents. In addition the Semperit Group has published an annual Modern Slavery Act Statement since in accordance with the UK Modern Slavery Act. The UK Modern Slavery Act which came into force on October aims to support laws and policies against modern slavery and human trafficking while calling on all major companies to publish an annual statement on their contribution to preventing modern slavery and human trafficking. This statement includes the most important principles as well as the companys activities in the relevant financial year and can be found on the Semperit website. HUMAN RIGHTS AND SOCIAL STANDARDS Without exception Semperit opposes child and forced labour and stands for fair wages as well as freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. There is zero tolerance for discrimination harassment and violations of corporate principles regardless of where in the value chain they occur. Information training and corrective actions will be used to ensure that the highest social standards are practised everywhere and that respect for and protection of human rights is a top priority at all times.

The impacts of climate change such as prolonged droughts and wildres are having a signicant impact on biodiversity globally. Freeport is committed to proactively managing the impacts of our mining operations on the environment including its biodiversity. OUR APPROACH Freeport seeks to avoid or minimize the adverse impacts of our operations on biodiversity and ecosystem services while promoting opportunities to contribute to the conservation and enhancement of biodiversity in the areas where we operate. Our conservation initiatives aim to produce benets for both biodiversity and people build trust and support our social license to operate. We seek to engage our employees local communities and other interested stakeholders in this work. We foster diverse partnerships with global stakeholders across private public and civil sectors to achieve greater accountability and promote the longterm ecacy for our biodiversity projects. These collaborations often serve as the basis for our community outreach and STEM education opportunities to help build capacity for learners of all ages. In we continued our eorts to implement the mitigation hierarchy a framework that emphasizes best practices for managing biodiversity and ecosystem services through the avoidance minimization restoration and osetting of impacts. During the year we developed a global guidance for consistent and rigorous application of the mitigation hierarchy through which we aim to manage risks and potential impacts with the longterm ambition of no net loss for new mines and major expansion projects at existing mines. We recognize the mitigation hierarchy is most eective when implemented during the earliest phases of project planning to help maximize opportunities for avoidance and minimization of impacts. In we are working to integrate the hierarchy into our existing project development process and we are training our environmental and operational teams to support its routine use.

98,Responsible procurement measures OUR CLIENTS AND OUR MARKETPLACE SUPPLY CHAIN ETHICS When engaging suppliers we make our choices very carefully. We make sure our decisions are purposeled. So we have been challenging our processes being progressive making business better and striving for a more diverse range of suppliers. We ask our buyers to put all their sourcing and supplier requirements with limited exceptions through our procurement gateway. We have honed and improved our supplier due diligence process to identify potential risks and red ag any risks that are signicant. For example our process is designed to ag supplier issues around modern slavery and environmental policies before those become embedded in our supply chain. Our dedicated team and relevant risk experts take all the information available from due diligence into account as part of our procurement process. We make sure we are condent in all relevant areas before giving a supplier our ofcial green light. Encouraging diversity throughout our supply chain Supporting and showcasing diversity in action is a core component of our Supplier Diversity Programme. In October we created a video clip featuring the success of our diverse supplier portfolio to share internally and externally. Two of our diverse suppliers were given a platform to share their experiences of working with us as well as encouraging others in the business who hold the purchasing purse to consider diverse suppliers. Our Central Procurement Contracts team have developed relationships with organisations such as WeConnect International who champion women owned businesses and MSDUK who promote ethnic minorityowned businesses. We look to them to help us offer more choice to our rms buyers. As a result we have been able to access their diverse supplier directories and engage with other corporates in their network to learn from their diversity journey. Our afliation to these organisations is as much about supporting diverse suppliers as it is about engaging them as evidenced by the following think tank and training sessions June our Business Development Team worked with a certied MSDUK supplier Stickology to form a Think Tank Session which allowed the supplier to tap into the skill set of our global brand and marketing team and looked at ways of impactfully increasing the companys digital footprint in order to upscale and compete for business. October in conjunction with Global Butterflies a transdiverse organisation we facilitated a session for our client services workplace team and onsite supplier security and catering staff on trans and nonbinary inclusion. At Pinsent Masons we want to work with suppliers that share our purpose and values and who reect our communities. By building a diverse and inclusive supply chain we are able to create opportunities for diverse suppliers to compete for our business who can bring in fresh ideas and talent and offer a broader base of experience all of which makes business work better for everyone.,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,val

115,INVESTMENT DESCRIPTION SMA is the fth largest meter asset provider in the UK with a portfolio of c..m smart electricity and gas meters installed in domestic premises. Established in the company nances the purchase and installation of smart meters on behalf of energy suppliers retaining ownership of the assets and collecting monthly rental payments under secure longterm leasing contracts. With the responsibility for the installation operation and maintenance of the meters fully transferred to the lessees SMA has a simple business model with immaterial operational risk exposure. Moreover SMA benets from favourable market dynamics from the UK Governmentmandated rollout of smart meters. SMAS APPROACH TO ESG Smart meters are an integral part of the transition to a safe and decarbonised energy system with lower energy consumption expected through real time updates of energy use higher energy supplier switching to lower carbon energy suppliers e.g. some energy suppliers oer renewable energy taris the introduction of timeofuse taris which shift energy consumption to low demand periods reducing the need for grid reinforcement and faster detection and communication of emergencies leaks res and other to network operators and energy suppliers. SMAs business is a key driver of the investment in this transition.The impact of SMAs business activities on the environment are indirectly through its suppliers and customers e.g. installers who drive to customers premises a thirdparty contractor who disposes of the meters. The environmental impact of these business activities is very limited and SMAs partners have strong ESG credentials. SMA was previously covered by ESG policies and procedures at a group level which ceased upon the investment date. Arcus plans to establish a comprehensive set of company policies such as Health Safety Environmental Data Management and Data Protection Policy. We will look to put in place an operations manual and environmental plan and include monthly Board reporting on Health Safety Compliance as well as a summary of the companys monthly performance with respect to a set of ESG KPIs.

137,Approach and goals Group goal Assess all major suppliers compliance with the RBA Code of Conduct. Advania is part of the Responsible Business Alliance We want to contribute to improved working conditions and environmental practices in IT supply chains. In addition customers and other stakeholders place similar requirements on companies regardless of their size and strength. To boost our capacity to drive sustainability improvements we decided to join forces with the RBA and their more than members. Joining the RBA entailed carrying out a review of Advania Groups suppliers and adapting our supplier monitoring programme to theirs. A working group with representatives from all Advania countries headed by Advania Swedens sustainability specialist coordinates Advania Groups supplier dialogue and followup. Joint Code of Conduct The RBA Code of Conduct promotes good working conditions in the electronics industry and industries in which electronics are sourced or produced. It also seeks to create safe supply chains where workers are treated with respect and dignity and that business operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically. Most of the IT industry both buyers and their suppliers have commied to the Code. Advania took part in the latest update of the RBA Code of Conduct. Version. came into force on January and contains stricter requirements in several areas for instance measuring reporting and reducing carbon emissions. We expect all our suppliers of IT products to adopt both RBAs and Advania Groups Codes of Conduct. All other suppliers implement Advanias Code of Conduct. Supplier assessment process Advanias Group goal is to assess the compliance of all major suppliers with the Codes of Conduct of both Advania and the RBA. Consequently we direct our eorts to where we believe they will have the most impact and where the largest portion of our product cost is spent. Major suppliers are reported to the RBA and assessed by Advania on an annual basis. Our RBAaligned supplier evaluation process begins with a selfassessmentquestionnaire SAQ. Based on the results of the selfassessment and the risk assessment provided by the RBA we decide if an additional followup is required. This may involve a thirdparty audit. When we nd deviations we ask the supplier to develop an improvement action plan. We follow up all deviations and action plans. Should a supplier fail to remedy noncompliances we continue the dialogue and if needed escalate the issue to our executive team. In addition to this we aim to conduct annual meetings with all our major suppliers to understand their work with sustainability in the supply chain and to collaborate where it is possible to drive positive change.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,val

150,The HaberBosch process that enables the production of ammonia is one of the transformative innovations of the twentieth century. Billions of lives have been made possible because ammonia and nitrogen fertilizers raise crop yields so that the world can feed a growing population and use less land to do it preserving carbonsequestering forests. Fertilizer is responsible for of the worlds food supply. At the same time HaberBosch is an energy intensive process that results in carbon emissions when using fossil fuels as a feedstock. We actively manage our network to maximize efficiency and reduce our emissions intensity. Today we do this in three ways Choice of feedstock The two most common hydrogen feedstocks for ammonia production are natural gas and coal. All CF Industries facilities use natural gas which results in onethird the carbon emissions compared to the use of coal. Investing in our manufacturing network CF Industries continually invests in our locations to improve safety energy efficiency and reliability. Over the past years we have invested approximately billion in our facilities to enhance safety improve efficiency and add stateoftheart manufacturing technologies.

166,ESG research is also generally integrated into the management of all funds not least as a means of improving the ESG score of the respective fund. With effect from April Asset Management was restructured as the most important organizational unit for sustainable investment. The current positioning ensures that sustainability is integrated in all investment processes and anchored in the entire organizational structure of the fund company. This means that ESG issues are now dealt with on a broad basis throughout asset management. In addition binding training measures have been put in place. Asset Management structure Raiffeisen KAG As a result of the restructuring process sustainability has been established as an overarching interdisciplinary topic. Alongside the Investment department the Corporate Responsibility department has been established comprising Product Management and the newly formed Sustainability Ofce. The newly formed Sustainability Ofce is responsible for sustainabilityrelated policies and is involved in advancing the sustainable investment process. The responsibilities of the Sustainability Ofce also include engagement and company dialogs impact measurement collaborations with universities and certication. In addition the Sustainability Ofce assists the operational fund management team with securitiesbased sustainability assessment and analysis of the investment suitability of securities. One key milestone in the reorganization of Raiffeisen KAG is the establishment of major sustainabilityrelated topics as future issues. These key topics that are so crucial and promising for asset management in general and sustainable asset management in particular such as smart energy healthcare and digitalization are dealt with by interdisciplinary analyst teams made up of fund managers and sustainability experts. They set out priorities positions and ultimately opinions and policies on the respective topics. The future issues are also covered from an organizational perspective embedded in the procedural ow chart. They are also a major factor in the continuous deepening and expansion of sustainability expertise within Raiffeisen KAG. This not least reected in our consistently intensied commitment in the sense of exercising our right to vote or actively communicating with listed companies on ESG issues. The exercise of voting rights is an important element of the investment approach for sustainability funds not least because corporate governance is an important pillar of the sustainability analysis.

168,SUSTAI NABI LITY R EPORT The production plants and infrastructure facilities that BKW constructs are built to be used for decades. In addition predictive maintenance and replacement of individual components extend the service life of functional systems. When plants reach the end of their lives BKW looks for ways to reuse materials and is committed to waste avoidance and recycling. For example this is how the dismantling of the Mhleberg Nuclear Power Plant was handled. Materials are reused or recycled whenever reasonable and possible. The splinter protection stones were cleaned and tested repeatedly for radioactivity to ensure that they could be safely used elsewhere. They were then crushed and processed into cement in several stages. This enabled metric tons of concrete to be retained in the material cycle for use in new structures. The two block transformers are also valuable resources and one of them was reused in another power plant. The second was professionally dismantled and recycled. Extending the life of batteries from electric cars In a joint pilot project BKW Energy and startup sunwheel are testing solutions for more sustainable production and consumption patterns. After an electric car has traveled approximately kilometers the batteries can be given a second use and used for another years as storage units for surplus solar power which makes it possible to better deal with load peaks in power consumption. This project helps one hand the service life of existing products is extended in a way that makes sense and on the other hand no additional products are required that would otherwise assume these functions.

177,RA International Sustainability Report SOCIALPEOPLE SKILLS DEVELOPMENT Our aim is to maintain a high ratio of local to international staff. This aligns with our overall desire to be a responsible corporate citizen and more communities. From the outset we recognised the value of hiring and developing local talent. Over the past years we have steadily built up the necessary structures to implement this approach from country to country and project to project. who we can hire and when resulting in our local labour There are many factors that contributed to the reduction in our average local labour participation in however the primary reason is that we successfully concluded several contracts in East and Central Africa which hosted large local workforces. We also experienced customer driven delays in commencing new contracts as a result of the pandemic. Looking at our upcoming projects we expect a rise in local labour participation again in. In parallel to local labour participation how we treat our staff and what growth opportunities we can offer is equally as important. In we set a goal to promote of our local workforce each year over a year period. Since many of our local employees join RA as unskilled or semiskilled workers preparing them for higher positions is a big commitment Despite being prevented from rolling out many of the formal training and promotion programs for our local staff due to COVID protocol restrictions we reached our goal to promote of local staff in largely as a result of reassessed skills and representing of total promotions across the company. We further meeting our target in the coming two years in which we expect our local labour participation to rise again develop skills assessment programmes develop local staff training programs that will add value to current and future projects introduce mentoring programs where applicable to transfer skills and cultivate links and partnerships with local and international universities and training centres to set up recruitment options andor training activities for local staff.,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,val
178,Transport and logistics Incoming goods In close collaboration with our suppliers and colleagues in Asia we continuously increase the filling rate in containers while developing smarter packaging and loading solutions throughout our value chain. Modern warehouse Rustas central warehouse located in Norrkping is as of the financial year one of the largest distribution centers in the Nordics. Our warehouse has the capacity to store more than pallets. Constructed in recent years have seen some major expansions made the latest expansion contains a separate building capable of storing an estimated pallets. Having a centralized distribution center means that Rusta can collect all goods under one roof. This eliminates unnecessary transports while improving filling rates leading to lower environmental impact and higher costefficiency. The location for our distribution center is carefully chosen to ensure Vicinity to the container port in the harbour km to reduce transport distance Vicinity to railroad to enable railway transportation both to and from the warehouse Vicinity to Rustas biggest market and easy highway access to minimize distribution distance To save energy the entire building is heated by geothermal heating. Moreover the warehouse solely uses LEDlighting. The LEDlighting reduces energy consumption by an estimated compared to conventional light bulbs. Furthermore a pickbyvoicesystem allows Rusta to save more than three tons of printpaper every year. For several years we have strived to develop improved processes in automatic stretch wrapping machines to reduce plastic use. Thus by using a thinner but stronger plastic film we save more than ten tons of plastic every year. Distribution to stores Rusta has started to implement a new central replenishment system which will secure that products are delivered at exactly the right time to the exact place and in just the right amount. The system helps us to reduce any unnecessary inventory costs and unneeded transportation of goods back and forth from our stores. Moreover flexible delivery route planning allows us to choose the most suitable delivery schedule. The warehouse management system is designed to ensure that all pallets are filled all to ensure that our transports are packed to a maximum thereby minimising emissions. To avoid traffic and save fuel whenever possible we deliver all goods during the night to the north of Sweden. We also utilise railroad for distribution of goods to nearby stores.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,val
179,CMPs operations have an impact on biodiversity within and in the vicinity of the port area. Our customers need to be able to leave waste in the port without harming the marine environment. Therefore we are actively involved on a broad front in caring for marine life. Through cooperation and innovation we will preserve and develop biodiversity in the port area. The total volume of waste produced during the year decreased sharply and this was primarily due of the year an extensive inventorying of recycling sites in Malm was initiated with the aim of improving out recycling procedures within our operations to make them Plastic in the oceans is one of the great sustainability challenges of our time. To combat this locally CMP is making a lecting plastic and other waste from the port basins as well as by eliminating the use of singleuse plastic products in our own operations. We are also involved in raising awareness about littering in the port and among our employees. In World Cleanup Day was marked with a competition which encouraged employees to pick up litter in their neighbourhood and in wildlife areas benefiting both the environment and people. Waste from CMPs activities and collected from the ships. CMP protects our ecosystems and is involved in several initiatives to promote biodiversity. An example of this is that we are currently looking into the possibility of introducing artificial habitats in the long term to protect fry.In consultation with the authorities a new method is also being tested in Swede Harbour to protect a rare redlisted species of the European green toad. By filling ditches with crushed limestone large amounts of precipitation are caught and purified before being released into the port basin. The result is that the toads avoid these ditches and stay in the area around the pond.Another example is the very unusual field rose which grows in the port of Malm and is spreading via its wide root system. To allow the field rose to grow undisturbed CMP has put up a fence around the mother plant and takes great care when carrying out groundwork near the rose.To energy or material recovery tonnes To landfill tonnes WASTE TREATMENT CMP PROTECTS OUR ECOSYSTEMS AND IS INVOLVED IN SEVERAL INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE BIODIVERSITY Target.

186,ANNUAL REPORT ON SUSTAINABILITY ANNUAL REPORT ON SUSTAINABILITY Waste Management WHY IT MATTERS In addition to mining and mineral processing wastes such as tailings waste rock overburden and slag our operations generate nonmining waste which requires proper endoflife management. Responsible management of all these materials is critical to complying with environmental regulations maintaining community and environmental health and social acceptance of our operations. OUR APPROACH Freeport is committed to reducing our environmental impact which includes the eective management of our mining and nonmining wastes alike. The volume of mining and processing wastes varies depending on site operating plans. These materials are typically managed in designated engineered stockpiles or impoundments as discussed in more detail in the prior Tailings Stewardship section. In addition to responsibly managing our mining and mineral processing waste we continuously evaluate opportunities to reduce the quantity of nonmining waste generated. We implement robust practices to identify categorize store and manage nonmining wastes and we strive to increase recycling and reuse of materials in our operations whenever possible. We evaluate our hazardous waste streams and when possible substitute materials with lower toxicity into our processes. Policies Programs In addition to Freeports dedicated TSTs responsible for managing our mining and processing waste we also have a dedicated global waste management team composed of subject matter experts from across the company. The team is responsible for advancing our technical expertise and developing leadership skills through multisite collaboration. Our experts provide guidance to support global consistency in our waste management programs and the companys Environmental Policy. The program identies best practices and opportunities for continuous improvement.

187,Communities Indigenous Peoples WHY IT MATTERS The relationship between a mining company and its neighboring communities is dynamic. Mining is an inherently cyclical business with production levels uctuating over time. While copper and molybdenum mines typically have long lives mining resources ultimately are nite. Increasing automation technical innovation and shifts in the global economy are changing mining processes and labor requirements. Furthermore many Indigenous Peoples have historically occupied or have ancestral connections to lands on or near mining operations. Mining companies must work collaboratively with host communities including Indigenous Peoples to build and maintain trust and to support them in developing the necessary skills and capabilities to adapt and succeed over the long term. This ongoing collaboration is critical to maintaining a social license to operate. OUR APPROACH Freeport strives to work in partnership with our host communities and Indigenous Peoples to earn and maintain their trust and deliver shared value. We not only seek to avoid minimize and mitigate adverse impacts from our operations but we also aim to provide longlasting benets to our neighbors. We work in partnership with our host communities which in many cases includes Indigenous Peoples to help build resilience and wellbeing at the individual and community level to help people thrive over the life of our mines and beyond. Proactive ongoing engagements and constructive dialogue are foundational to our approach. This is how we understand actual potential and perceived impacts on our host communities build trust and mutually identify the most relevant social investments and development priorities to address our impacts and support enhanced resilience. We also work actively through engagement and partnership activities to support host communities in maximizing the social and economic benets of our operations. While we tailor our programs to sitespecic dynamics of the operation and host communities our overarching objectives in partnership with local stakeholders remain consistent. In summary they are build enduring trust avoid minimize or mitigate any adverse impacts from our operations maximize the positive benets and support our communities in building the resilience necessary to thrive and adapt during and beyond the life of the mine.

190,Collaboration is key We know we cannot solve all of these challenges alone. We are working with key partners upstream and downstream to build strong and effective collaboration. Following our net sustainable RD strategy our upstream collaboration focuses on getting access to more sustainable raw materials. One example of our downstream collaboration is the introduction of CPV which is the outcome of collaboration between Beckers Sweden Beckers central LongTerm RD unit customers and most major electrical steel companies. Stakeholder engagement In we provided training for RD employees on the BSI and netsustainable products and ensured that they are thoroughly informed about Beckers goals. We also began to implement attractive incentives such as integrating sustainability targets into variable compensation. We know that cocreation with customers and suppliers is key for the development of more sustainable products. We are in continuous exchange with our customers to assess the effectiveness of new more sustainable products and product features. For example we are working with our customers RD teams to identify ways in which together we will reduce the carbon footprint of coil coated steel. Part of the solution lies in reducing the carbon footprint of our customers own coil coating process and part of it lies in reducing the carbon footprint of the products we sell to them. With our suppliers we work on finding new ways to make our coatings materially more sustainable. We already have a number of paints and technologies such as waterbased radiation curing biobased that either support our customers in reducing CO e emission on their lines or reduce the embedded CO in their products. Life Cycle Analysis We have started to develop our own bespoke Life Cycle Analysis LCA tool. It enables us to determine the carbon footprint of our products in order to define the carbon in our products and become reflective on the use of more sustainable materials and improvements to our own manufacturing processes. Reducing impacts Wherever possible we use materials that are nontoxic to humans and the environment. We aim to sell coatings that have minimal VOCs and CO e emissions. We are also looking at how new types of paint formulations can reduce the carbon footprint of the coil coating process itself e. g. UV and electron beam curing. This reflects Beckers ambition to take a more endtoend approach looking across the full value chain in seeking more sustainable solutions. Embracing the circular economy We promote the use of renewable raw materials and avoid using any minerals that are scarce or endangered. Moreover we develop and sell coatings that provide proven functional sustainability benefits for customers and society whilst in service. Circular economy approaches are a major focus of our longerterm RD and Innovation activities. For example we are looking at using biosourced raw materials and recycled plastic content in Beckers product formulations.

191,Cohesion Local commitment Spar Nords operations rely on a strong local presence and decentralised decisionmaking powers. Accordingly we naturally engage with the local communities in which we operate. Through our local banks we actively participate in local communities and support initiatives as well as associations to the benefit of local community cohesion. Spar Nord has a longstanding tradition of sponsoring small and large associations and initiatives. We believe we have a particularly important responsibility for helping to develop healthy and sustainable associations in all communities where we have a presence. In the Bank granted sponsorships for more than DKK million. In close collaboration with the Spar Nord Foundation Spar Nord Bank each year supports both small and large initiatives across Denmark. The Spar Nord Foundation owns approximately of Spar Nord Bank and the dividends from this ownership interest are some of the funds that we channel back into associations and local communities. Marine litter reduced by. tonnes in DenmarkIn autumn Spar Nord Banks employees spent working hours contributing to a national marine litter initiative in which dedicated local citizens school children associations and businesses were invited to help make a difference. In a pooled effort . tonnes of marine litter was collected from Danish beaches. Since the Spar Nord Foundation has donated around DKK million to the Danish Navys marine environment campaign Havmiljvogterne which is focused on reducing marine litter in and around the oceans. Spar Nords national marine litter action was thus an extension of a purpose already supported by the Spar Nord Foundation.Spar Nord Bank plans to repeat the marine litter collection initiative in. Schools associations businesses or private individ uals who want to support the good cause can at any time pick up bags for collecting marine litter from their local Spar Nord branch. For more information about the campaign see havmiljovogter.dk Risks The local cohesion and the personal relations and commitments are required to create positive change and progress in local communities. Failure to stimulate meetings in person and practical collaboration in local com munities entails a risk of reduced attractiveness of a local community and jeopardise the wellbeing of the citizens to the detriment of citizens opportunities and ultimately Spar Nords business. However the autonomous and decentralised commitment of each individual bank in local communities also involves a risk of favouritism and nepo tism in relation to sponsorships and donations. Policy Spar Nord and the Spar Nord Foundation aim to make a joint and active contribution to the society we are all part of. We do that by granting sponsorships and donations focused on community culture community association activities and social commitment. To make sure the funds are distributed for the right purposes and have the greatest possible impact all applications for the Spar Nord Foundation are assessed on the basis of a number of impact principles including whether a project would make a great or small contribution to supporting communities knowledge and learning visibility sustainability and innovation.,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,val

196,A Better Community LOCAL COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT During summer we hosted a workshop session Make BC Greener where Better Collective employees discussed initiatives for making our organisation and business more environmentally friendly. As a pilot project in the Copenhagen headquarters management and employees were given the open task to make BC greener. During the workshop we saw high employee engagement which resulted in plenty of ideas some of which are implemented already. Some are easy to implement others require research and a change of business procedures. Still letting the whole organisation pitch in in crossfunctional teams proved to be very fruitful. It is evident that doing good for the environment is a topic which creates high engagement and motivation among our employees. We will continue to raise awareness and to spark new ideas for improvement rolling out the workshop across our oces from. CaseMAKE BC GREENER We recognise our responsibility to go beyond our core business and contribute to the local communities where we are active. Also we want to minimise our environmental impact. Most of our community work is currently focused on our operations in Nis Serbia under the program name Better Nis. As one of the largest tech employers in Nis we recognise our role and potential impact on the local community which is why this became the point of departure of our Better Community program. We have an ambition to roll out further local community programs in other key markets in the years to come. We have always been committed to making responsible decisions across all operations this is also the case when it comes to our impact on the environment. As we are an online service company our impact is relatively small. Still we aim to minimise our carbon footprint and contribute to a greener environment. Calculating our carbon footprint for the rst time in it is evident that air travel accounts for almost of our emissions. With oces in countries and frequent participation in meetings and conferences abroad we value the personal contact in business relations as well as an integrating factor between our oces. However a travel policy is in the making with the aim of substituting a reasonable part of travel with video conferencing. Remote meeting facilities are in place in most oces and are kept up to standard to facilitate online meetings as an alternative.

We accept that RA is unlikely to achieve gender parity given the cultures and industries we work in. However our growth in existing markets and expansion into new territories provide us with an exciting opportunity to improve on our gender ratio. Further details of our gender ratio by country can be found on page . This highlights how cultural differences can affect the percentage of women we are able to recruit in each country. Our threeyear target is to increase the percentage of women in RAs workforce to in up from in. While our annual average still stands at women we have made some important strides this year We proactively seek and hire female applicants especially for roles traditionally held by men. We ran a workshop involving all key personnel barriers that prevent more women from joining our workforce. These barriers vary from country to country so each country team has initiated their own action plan to overcome the challenges. We recognised the need to encourage the proportion of female applicants for professional roles within our organisation. To address this we increased our female follower base on LinkedIn to in up from in. We participated in Target Gender Equality a gender equality accelerator program by the UN Global Compact that aims at deepening companies implementation of the Womens Empowerment Principles to which we are a signatory. With this strong foundation we continue to be target of women by the end of. Beyond our intention is to analyse and set targets for gender on seniority levels within the company as well. In we sought to hire local women to senior roles traditionally held by men where there were vacancies.

206,PERFORMANCEProperty Subsidence Management Plans PSMP are available at all operating mines in Australia. Those plans are regularly reviewed especially if there are any changes in the mine plans. Subsidence management activities are performed according to the plan at all mines. To date the existing monitoring has not detected any miningrelated impacts. The ongoing monitoring program continues to assess the risk of the current operations on environment and communities including the utilization of the D photogrammetry in subsidence monitoring at Airly mine. MINE SUBSIDENCESubsidence is common over underground mines. Inecient subsidence management may lead to fatal injury of miners while surface subsidence may aect the environment such as changing morphology of land settlements interrupting the hydrologic environment as well as damaging infrastructures and surrounded residents. MANAGEMENT APPROACH The Company integrates subsidence management into mine plans and then submits to related government agencies for approval. Since the mine subsidence movement can be predicted Centennial a subsidiary of the Company operating underground mines in Australia has frequently performed a risk assessment on subsidence. The assessment results are then integrated with a geological model to formulate the subsidence management plan to minimize possible subsidence impact. Through the implementation subsidence monitoring has been undertaken over the potential areas to access subsidence impacts. The actual impacts have been compared against the estimated impacts and used further to rene the subsidence model and nally improve the subsidence management plan.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,val
207,THIS IS BERNERUp to of our production in Heinvesi is powered by renewable energy In recent years we have been able to substantially increase the share of renewable energy sources at our Heinvesi plants. For several years now the energy consumption of the H plant producing ethanolbased products and of the attached H vinegar production plant has been derived almost entirely . from renewable sources. The fuel oil used for auxiliary power is still nonrenewable. We have found eective solutions for increasing the share of renewable energy used by the H plant which produces cosmetics and hygiene products to. We decided to change our heating method in and achieved the target of renewable energy in the latter part of the year. Renewable energy accounted for. of the energy consumption in Heinvesi Viinikkala and Helsinki in. Our goal is to further increase that percentage during the monitoring period. We use renewable fuels to transport our products from Heinvesi In we switched to renewable fuel in transporting products manufactured in our inhouse production operations between the Heinvesi plants and our logistics centre in Vantaas Viinikkala district. The calculated greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by an estimated tonnes per year corresponding to a reduction of approximately of the total emissions on the route in question. This estimate is based on a WelltoWheels WtW calculation that takes into account the full lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of fuel. We have also used renewable fuel for our minor transport operations in the capital region since the beginning of October. We held negotiations concerning the transport of contractmanufactured products to assess various options for using biofuels in our product transport operations. We are further developing our Scope reporting We have improved and will further improve our reporting on our indirect Scope emissions. Late in the year we made a commitment to the Science Based Targets climate initiative which involves preparing a scheduled roadmap and actions for reducing emissions in accordance with the.C target stipulated by the Paris Agreement by the end of. Berners SBTi commitment applies to Berners whollyowned subsidiaries in Finland Sweden Norway and the Baltics. This also includes the new subsidiaries acquired in Belor Agro Ltd Naviter Ltd Haltija Ltd and Dolema AB in Sweden. The environmental indicators of our new subsidiaries will be reported in next years report. A large part of our total emissions consist of Scope emissions from the value chain such as raw materials and logistics. Berner Ltd has leased cars in Finland.

GOOD NEIGHBOR COMMITMENTSSwitch is actively engaged in mitigating its impact on the environment and communities where its data centers are located. This involves technologies used on the generators for mechanical noise reduction which includes engine plenums. Switch also increased the area density and thickness of the internal insulation materials. To strengthen exhaust noise reduction we installed larger internal exhaust silencers with additional external secondary silencers .While most of Switchs data center campus locations are within commercially zoned areas in the fast growing city of Las Vegas residential areas sprung up and singlefamily houses became our neighbors. We wanted to ensure the sheer size of Switchs data centers and air handlers did not detrimentally impact the surrounding neighborhood. To ensure this Switch hired a thirdparty consultant to evaluate the noise level for our air handling units. The consultant conducted a study that would assist the company in avoiding negative impacts in residential neighborhoods. The Previously deployed air handler units were designed so that the compressors were not fully enclosed. The compressors away and as the units ran longer and harder it resulted in higher noise levels. To address this issue the compressors were moved within the AHU and fully enclosed with padding so that they strike a critical balance for the environment and precious natural resources. This project represents a major advancement for Nevada and we applaud Switch and their partners for continuing to push the envelope of sustainable business operations and renewable energy.
