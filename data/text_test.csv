8,Sustainable Development Goals Two of the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs were classied as particularly relevant for RBI in inhouse ecology. These include SDG Climate Protection Measures as well as SDG Affordable and Clean Energy. It is important to counteract climate change by reducing direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. RBIs options for exerting direct inuence on the environment predominantly lie in the areas of energy consumption electricity and heat and the mobility sector and to a lesser extent waste production as well as resource and water consumption. All these areas can be found in the Sustainable Development Goals for example SDG water SDG energy and proportion of green electricity energy efciency SDG consumption and productionwaste and SDG climate protection. Water consumption and waste have a relatively small footprint at RBI which is why SDG and SDG are not listed separately. Environmental targets Central tool for the implementation and further development of the environmental targets is the environmental management system in Austria which is operated in accordance with the requirements of ISO certied since. In addition the greenhouse gases have been validated for RBI since in accordance with ISO. The Environmental Committee Group Sustainability Management Facility Management and Sustainability Ofcers at the network banks are primarily responsible for implementing and evaluating the achievement of our goals. Details on the goals can be found on our website at www.rbinternational.comsustainabilitymanagement. With reference to the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris COP RBI has set itself the target of reducing its CO emissions by percent by percent by and percent by Scope and separately for Scope. This will be achieved by means of energy efciency a higher proportion of green electricity a reduction in business travel and information measures for employees who are key players when it comes to achieving the environmental targets.

We regard education as the single most important key to social and economic development.We support many individual educational projects across our markets working with schools universities NGOs and governments to create education opportunities for those who would otherwise find them difficult to access.During we targeted more than of our sustainability spending on projects relating to our education and economic growth pillar. Although several events were postponed or held virtually during the first half of the year due to the COVID pandemic our sustainability initiatives were generally unaffected. All our sustainability initiatives are financial donations and contribution inkind engagements by sharing our expertise and resources.In most of the markets where we operate there is limited fixedline telecommunications infrastructure. Consequently people rely solely on mobile telephony to meet their urgent daytoday needs including access to education and employment. Our towers therefore indirectly play an essential role in enabling people in these markets to access these opportunities. Inparticular we recognize the literacy and employment inequalities between developed countries and the emerging markets where we operate. This pillar strives to address thisdiscrepancy.We support many individual educational projects across our markets working with schools universities NGOs and governments to create education opportunities for those who would otherwise find them difficult to access.photo credit Save the Children International Nigeria.CASE STUDY Education for Crisis Affected Girls partnership with Save the ChildrenIHS Nigeria partnered with Save the Children International to help girls in the northeastern regions such as Borno and Yobe access education.

People Our longterm ambition is to grow our business while reducing our environmental impact. To track and encourage progress towards this goal we set annual targets for energy use VOC emissions and waste. Our latest results illustrate the progress we are making in this journey. On the following pages we will look at our environmental key performance indicators the impact the changes in business operations had on those indicators and how they were inuenced by other environmental factors as well as our site initiatives. As a chemical industry manufacturer energy efciency and CO footprint are two of our key sustainability topics. To support sustainable development globally we need to drive energy efciency across our operations and the transportation of our goods and we need to use energy from renewable sources wherever possible. In addition some coatings include volatile organic compounds VOCs. These not only have a signicant impact on the climate but they may also have an impact on health. We have therefore set targets for reducing greenhouse gases and VOC emissions. Finally we also have ambitious targets to reduce the amount of waste from our operations and we are seeking ways to eliminate or repurpose waste wherever we can. Our approach What How Our sites aim for carbon neutral business activities. Source renewable energy for our production activities. Implement energy efciency programs. Promote innovative initiatives to minimize the carbon emissions from travel. Reduce VOC emissions signicantly. Our operations endorse the principles of circular economy resources are conserved and repurposed. Strive to eliminate waste. Reduce to zero the amount of waste sent to landll. Repurpose reuse or recycle our waste. Water used as a raw material will be conserved and responsibly sourced. Implement a comprehensive wastewater management system.

In the financial year CO emissions from our production dropped by. The reduced CO emissions are a result of our investment in energy optimisation for production in Sklskr in the financial year a small decrease in production volume and a changed product mix.

Last year we launched an energy management project where the goal is to be able to measure and reduce energy consumption and CO emissions from production in both our companies. Our company in Dargun is already ISO certified. In the financial year we have strengthened the work on the project with the installation of measuring equipment and a systematic analysis for reducing energy consumption and CO emissions. With this work a data foundation is to be created which will support our objectives for. RESOURCE USE For the financial year a number of optimisation and maintenance investments have been planned which overall will further reduce resource consumption including optimisation of yield during production.

117,PERFORMANCEIn the Company experienced IT incidents. In February there was a Ransomware inltration into the Companys premises leading to temporary inaccessibility to all corporate applications. The IT infrastructure incident occurred in May which was caused by electricity failure during the server room maintenance. The server went down which aected the nancial application. For both cases the Company can eectively respond to the incident and be able to recover the system without signicant impact on the data and business operations. However the incident response rate data is not yet available as the data collection is under standardization. The Company expects to publish this performance data in Sustainability Report.

Leaks of customer data and cyberattack on the Companys database are considered as one of emerging risks. Therefore cybersecurity is built into enterprise risk management. The audit committee takes responsibility to oversee cybersecurity issues focusing on regulatory compliance and risk management associated with the digital technology utilization. Furthermore the Company conducts the Disaster Recovery Plan DRP exercise annually for the Companys critical data namely nancial data and enterprise documents. The eectiveness of response plan is then accessed by the third party as a part of the business continuity management system certication. To ensure transparency privacy and the protection of all information the Company at the same time has implemented the privacy policy to dene the purpose of data collection disclosure of information and security of personal data. This is to ensure data protection to any persons disclosing their personal information to the Company especially customers and the business partners.

118,Better for Bettors RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING Better Collective views sports betting and gambling purely as a form of entertainment and we want to make sure that our users and employees iGaming experiences remain as a form of fun and entertainment. This includes awareness of the fact that gambling should not be seen as a source of income but only be practised as a fun activity. When gambling the sole purpose should not be to increase ones initial stake but to set aside a stake that one is willing to lose for the sake of entertainment. This view of betting is the reason why we strongly endorse responsible gaming. When creating content or new platforms we always have responsible gambling in mind we aim to educate our users and to create transparency. We want to make sure that our users are better suited to navigate the iGaming world by visiting a Better Collective platform before registering an account with a sports betting or gambling operator. All our platforms focus on the teaching of gambling strategies and the presentation of insightful information and data to help our users feel more condent in their betting. However we do not and cannot guarantee winning and we will never claim to do so. As Better Collective is not a sports betting or gambling operator we rely on the operators as in our partners to scan for user behaviour and take action when a user shows signs of atrisk and problem gambling behaviour. Due to our position in the value chain and that all actual bets are placed with an operator we have limited data on our users and no data on their betting behaviour. We can help educate users making sure that they are aware of the legal gambling age of possible adverse eects of gambling and prevention. We are continuously assessing new measures to implement on our sites. Gambling addiction prevention At Better Collective we are fully aware that there are users for whom gambling surpasses entertainment and becomes a form of addiction. Our standpoint is that the entire iGaming industry needs to do all they can to minimise the risk for people turning into problem gamblers and take this responsibility seriously. Being one of the leading companies within the iGaming aliate industry we also feel a strong responsibility to do everything that is within our capabilities to support a safe online gambling environment.

Nevertheless we have been able to maintain a steady supply of raw materials to our customers thanks to the longstanding relationships with our suppliers both for products and services. At the same time COVID triggered an increased awareness with all stakeholders of the need to grow towards a more sustainable and environment friendly supply chain.

129,Sweco plans portions of North Bothnia Line The North Bothnia Line will run between Ume and Lule with km of new railway along northern Swedens coastline. Sweco has been commissioned by the Swedish Transport Administration to plan the new railway that will run between Norra Tuvan and central Skellefte a project expected to continue through. Sweco is responsible for producing the master plan and construction documents and will then serve as advisor during the construction process. The planning work needs to be innovative as project planning for the railway is being done in an urban environment. In addition to managing the complexity this entails the project is also hallmarked by sustainability. Social and economic aspects must be taken into consideration and the railway must be built with the minimum possible climate impact. Client Swedish Transport Administration Country Sweden New transport network in southern Germany Railbound trafc plays an important role in meeting peoples travel needs and reducing the transport sectors climate footprint. In southern Germany Sweco has been working with a project to create a local tram network based on existing rail lines. Memmingen station is a regional hub with tracks running past several nearby towns where no trains have stopped. Sweco was tasked with exploring options for creating an attractive local transport network using existing rails. In the project Sweco managed all design and planning work for six new stations in the greater Memmingen area scheduled to open in December. This is an important step in the regions pursuit of sustainable mobility and will make travel easier for residents. Client SWU Verkehr GmbH Country Germany Electrication of Norwegian ports In Norway some goods transport will be shifted from road to sea to reduce pressure on the roads and utilise the countrys long coastline and multiple ports. One challenge is that ships use a lot of fuel during loading and unloading generating emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful particles. Port electrication is therefore a key factor in shippings transition. Major investments are needed to electrify ports particularly small ports. For Nordord Vgan and Harstad Sweco analysed options for creating plugin solutions based on existing electricity grid capacity and investment grants from the Norwegian Environment and Climate Agency.

There are many reasons for the low representation of women in leading positions which stem from the personal and societal environment as well as the company itself. We believe it is necessary to change the structural conditions within the company in order to encourage women to apply for management positions. In measures were developed with a view to approaching this issue from various angles. We are starting by looking at the work culture in terms of enabling a healthy worklife balance and ensuring that the New World of Work is designed in a gender sensitive manner. As part of this we conducted the berufundfamilie audit for the rst time in see page and pressed ahead with active parental leave management.

150,Management approach Compliance with the present legal framework forms the basis to ensure traceability and proper risk assessment. Today compliance is mainly organised independently by each site. The most common approach is asking suppliers to complete a questionnaire covering their effort towards ecological and legal requirements. In we introduced a harmonised corporate policy a Supplier Code of Conduct SCoC. It lays out our strict environmental social and ethical standards throughout our supply chain. As we see the greatest lever to reduce our carbon footprint in our raw materials we started the rollout of the code of conduct with our raw material suppliers. Context Schur Flexibles aims to achieve full transparency of its supply chain. In this respect ensuring traceability throughout the entire supply chain is one of our key objectives. Furthermore we define the quality of our products by also considering environmental and social factors that arise throughout the supply chain. At the moment we have several sitebased initiatives in place. In addition we are working on a groupwide process to guarantee meeting environmental social and governance criteria and the highest quality with each of our suppliers. Boundaries In this group of three material topics the focus is on raw material suppliers. Transparency of supply chain social and environmental supplier assessment SDGs UNGC Projects. Supplier Code of Conduct KPIs With the announcement of a German supply chain law responsible supply chain management is on the political agenda but the industry is calling for a uniform European approach. Context It is in our core values to make responsible use of the planets resources meet the highest social standards and embody ethical integrity not only in our business but throughout the entire supply chain. Therefore we expect our suppliers to conduct business responsibly as well and this is why we created a Supplier Code of Conduct. Description The Supplier Code of Conduct enables us to implement a groupwide harmonised process to guarantee responsible production along the entirety of our supply chain. With the implementation of the SCoC we ensure the baseline of social ethical and environmental standards throughout our supply chain. The document encompasses fundamental principles of our Group Code of Conduct and is based on the ten principles of the United National Global Compact and core labour standards of the International Labour Organisation. Suppliers are asked to comply or agree to standards in four areas Business Integrity Labour Standards Health Safety and Environment.

182,PEOPLE ABSENCE DUE TO ILLNESS For several years absence due to illness has been decreasing for the company in Sklskr but in recent years absence due to illness for the group as a whole has been increasing. To address this issue employees with longterm absence will be offered an interview. A more targeted approach encouraging active dialogue during the interviews will ensure that the employee has the necessary support. Based on this we aim to reduce absence due to illness. However in next years specification of absence due to illness COVID must be taken into account. The rise in absence due to illness in Denmark for is due to an increase in the number of longterm absence cases days of absence due to illness as a result of serious nonwork related illness. WELLBEING Harboe emphasises general employee health and wellbeing as this helps to create a good environment for each employee. In future employee satisfaction surveys will be used more actively to promote motivation. For several years many employees in Sklskr have taken up the health check offer which is mandatory for nightshift workers but is offered to all employees every other year. In all employees will be offered health checks and we expect many employees to take up this offer. In Dargun employees are also offered regular health checks which form the basis for advice to the employee in the performance of their duties considering health aspects and the employees position including shift work. These checks will ensure that the employee is offered the proper aids to help reduce the risk of injuries and workrelated absence. We still focus on ensuring that the employee restaurants in both Denmark and Germany provide healthy balanced and nutritious food to all employees.

Talent management and development of management staff The identication and development of high potentials plays an important role in ensuring RBIs future business success. This improves the development and career opportunities of the employees themselves while also contributing to proactive and qualitative personnel planning and the targeted promotion and retention of our key employees. Various coordinated measures and concepts have been introduced for this purpose over the years. This includes the annual SpotGrowLead process which is aimed at identifying and developing high potentials. This has resulted in talent pipelines being established in almost all units with consideration of the different local focal points. The success of this ongoing process is demonstrated by the fact that percent of the Management Board positions were lled by internal candidates in. The Talent Development Framework is another example of a standardized process aimed at developing high potentials. The individuals identied in the SpotGrowLead process benet from a range of individual development measures including degree feedback personality assessments mentoring and coaching onthejob learning in the form of challenging projects and job rotation and seminars and programs aimed at improving their professional skills. We also create a space for high potentials to network exchange ideas and learn from each other at High Potential Networking Events which are held regularly for RBI AG as part of the Peter Drucker Forum in Vienna.

Another new feature in some areas of the company was the introduction of selfnomination in order to further strengthen the role of the individual in the context of personal and career development.
